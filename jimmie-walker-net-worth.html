Walker is most famous for playing James Evans Jr. ("J.J.") on the CBS sitcom "Good Times" (1974–1979), where he originated the popular catchphrase "Dyn-O-Mite!" Jimmie began performing stand-up comedy in the late '60s, and he has more than 50 acting credits to his name, including the films "Let's Do It Again" (1975) and "Airplane!" (1980), the TV movie "The Greatest Thing That Almost Happened" (1977), and the television shows "At Ease" (1983) and "Bustin' Loose" (1987–1988). In 2012, Walker published the book "Dynomite!: Good Times, Bad Times, Our Times–A Memoir."</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Jimmie Walker was born James Carter Walker Jr. on June 25, 1947, in Brooklyn, New York. He grew up in The Bronx with mother Lorena, father James Sr., and sister Beverly. James Sr. worked as a Pullman porter, and Lorena was the head of the nursing department at a hospital. Jimmie attended Theodore Roosevelt High School, and he took part in the SEEK (Search for Education, Evaluation, and Knowledge) program, which was funded by New York State. Through SEEK, Walker learned about radio engineering, and he was hired by the NYC radio station WRVR. Beginning with the 1964 World Series, Jimmie worked as a vendor at Yankee Stadium as a teenager, and Mickey Mantle once gave him a silver dollar.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Walker began his stand-up comedy career in 1969, and after appearing on the "Jack Paar Show" and "Rowan & Martin's Laugh In," the casting director for "Good Times" spotted Jimmie and cast him as James "J.J." Evans Jr. The series aired 133 episodes over six seasons and earned Walker two Golden Globe nominations. The catchphrase "Dy-no-mite!," which is credited to <a href=# title="John Rich Net Worth">John Rich</a>, one of the show's directors, was featured in the TV Land special "The 100 Greatest TV Quotes and Catch Phrases." While starring on "Good Times," Jimmie released the stand-up comedy album "Dyn-o-mite" (1975). Walker's co-stars <a href=# title="John Amos Net Worth">John Amos</a> and Esther Rolle became frustrated with the direction the show went in due to J.J.'s popularity, with Rolle stating, "He's 18 and he doesn't work. He can't read or write. He doesn't think. The show didn't start out to be that…Little by little—with the help of the artist, I suppose, because they couldn't do that to me—they have made J.J. more stupid and enlarged the role." Amos also voiced his displeasure, saying, "The writers would prefer to put a chicken hat on J.J. and have him prance around saying 'DY-NO-MITE,' and that way they could waste a few minutes and not have to write meaningful dialogue."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-321445 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Jimmie-Walker-1.jpg alt width=900 height=599 sizes="(max-width: 1686px) 100vw, 1686px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-321445 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Mark Davis/Getty Images for TV Land)</p><p>In 1975, Walker appeared in the <a href=# title="Sidney Poitier Net Worth">Sidney Poitier</a>-directed film "Let's Do It Again," followed by 1978s "Rabbit Test" and 1979's "The Concorde … Airport '79."
