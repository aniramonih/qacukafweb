Her parents were Zhenning and Zheng. When Liu was five years old, he moved to Kingston, Ontario, Canada with his parents.</p><p>He had been living with his grandparents in China before that. Liu was raised in Mississauga, Ontario after his family moved there from China. He went to high school at the University of Toronto Schools.</p><p>Afterward, he went to the University of Western Ontario’s Ivey Business School. SCMP says that Liu earned a business administration degree in 2011 with high honors.</p><p>After college, Liu worked as an accountant at Deloitte, but in April 2012, he was let go.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Simu: Early Life Details</h2><p>Liu was born in Harbin, China, on April 19, 1989. He lived with his grandparents until he was five years old when his parents moved with him to Kingston, Ontario, Canada. He grew up in the city of Mississauga, Ontario, and went to high school at the University of Toronto Schools. He then went to the Ivey Business School at the University of Western Ontario to study business administration. He graduated with honors in 2011.</p><p>Then he got a job as an accountant at Deloitte, but he soon realized he didn’t like it. He was eventually fired, and he started to look for other jobs. He made the decision to become an actor and stuntman.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Simu: Personal Life Details</h2><p>Liu has written about some of the things he learned growing up in an immigrant family. In 2018, he wrote an article about his experiences for Maclean magazine. Then, in 2019, he wrote a full book called “We Were Dreamers: An Immigrant Superhero Origin Story” that went into more detail about his life.</p><p>Liu likes the NBA team the Toronto Raptors. He also likes Star Wars movies and books.</p><p>Tina Jung, who was born in South Korea but lives in Canada, and Liu have been linked romantically. She was also in the TV show Kim’s Convenience. The couple has kept their personal life out of the spotlight and doesn’t post pictures of themselves online.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Simu: Net Worth 2022</h2><p><strong>Canadian stuntman and actor Simu Liu has a <a href=#>net worth</a> of $4 million as of 2022. </strong>Simu Liu is known for his roles in “Kim’s Convenience” and “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Simu Liu’s Acting History</h2><p>Liu grew up in the Canadian province of Ontario. In the early 2010s, he began working as an extra and stuntman in Hollywood. He played unnamed roles, for example, in the 2013 movie Pacific Rim and the TV show Nikita.</p><p>In 2016, he got his big break when he was cast as Jung Kim, one of the main characters, on the Canadian show Kim’s Convenience. The show had five seasons and won a lot of awards.</p><p>Kim’s Convenience gave Liu a lot more attention in the U.S. and Canada’s entertainment industries. He got small roles on shows like Orphan Black, Fresh Off the Boat, and Awkwafina Is Nora from Queens while the show was being filmed.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Simu Liu (@simuliu)</a></p></figure><p>In July 2019, Liu was officially chosen to play Shang-Chi. This made him the first Asian actor to play the main role in a Marvel Cinematic Universe movie.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is Simu Liu From ‘Shang-Chi’ Married Or Single?</h2><p>Liu is not married yet, but there are rumors that he is seeing someone. Glamour Fame said that he is seeing a woman named Tina Jung, but this has not been confirmed. Jung is an actress from Canada. She first worked with Liu in 2016 on the TV shows Beauty and the Beast and Kim’s Convenience. At the time, they posted some suspiciously cute pictures, which led fans to think that was when they started dating.</p><p>We know the following about Tina Jung. Even though she hasn’t gotten a role like Liu’s Shang-Chi, she has won some important awards. Jung was born in Canada to two actors, and she went on to become an actress in her own right. She is also a writer and producer. She and Liu worked together to write and make a short film called Meeting Mommy. According to her IMDb page, she has also been in the TV movie Heart of the Holidays and the TV show Suits.</p><p>Since neither Liu nor Jung has come out to say they are a couple, it is unclear how serious the relationship is, if there is one at all. It was said that Liu messed up one of his stunts on The Legend of the Ten Rings because he was trying to impress a woman on the set. In June, Liu talked to Vanity Fair about the event and said:</p><p>“There was a cute girl on the crew that I wanted to impress during a very complicated stunt. I gave her a wink, and when I started to run, I lost my balance, fell, hit my knee, and landed 12 feet in the air.”</p><p>So, we will have to wait and see if the Liu-Jung thing is true.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What’s Next For Simu Liu?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>Liu is working on several movies that will come out in the future.</p><p>The movie Arthur the King is being made right now, and Liu and Mark Wahlberg are both in it. It is based on a true story about a Swedish man who befriended a hurt stray dog in Ecuador while doing an adventure race.</p><p>Liu will also be in the movie version of One True Love, which is based on a book by Taylor Jenkins Reid. Variety says that the movie is “the moving love story of a woman who is suddenly forced to choose between the husband she has thought dead for a long time and the fiance who has brought her back to life.” Phillipa Soo and Luke Bracey are also in it.</p><p>It’s also important for Liu to play roles with Asian characters that show them in a positive light.</p><p>In an interview with CBC News in 2019, he said, “My journey in this industry has always been about fighting for representation and the right to belong.” Liu also said, “With ‘Crazy Rich Asians,’ we saw for the first time that a studio could look at Asians who were raised in the West—in Canada and the United States—and treat them as a separate group. That was a pretty important moment that changed the minds of a lot of studio executives and helped us get to where we are now. And I hope this is just the beginning.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xX6y1sHnIrGSsoZ2qeqO1zmauoqOZYrCivsSeqWamlal6uLvRrZ9mnaaav7rAx6KloGWppMJuusSem2asn2K4r7vWZpibp6WperW0xGaaoaGemsCmecKapZqcmZa7bq3CraarZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-simu-bio-wiki-career-net-worth-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-chinese-canadian-actor.html&text=Who%20Is%20Simu%3f%20Bio%2fwiki%20Career%20%26amp%3b%20Net%20Worth%20%20Everything%20You%20Need%20To%20Know%20About%20The%20Chinese-Canadian%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-simu-bio-wiki-career-net-worth-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-chinese-canadian-actor.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-simu-bio-wiki-career-net-worth-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-chinese-canadian-actor.html&title=Who%20Is%20Simu%3f%20Bio%2fwiki%20Career%20%26amp%3b%20Net%20Worth%20%20Everything%20You%20Need%20To%20Know%20About%20The%20Chinese-Canadian%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-simu-bio-wiki-career-net-worth-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-chinese-canadian-actor.html&title=Who%20Is%20Simu%3f%20Bio%2fwiki%20Career%20%26amp%3b%20Net%20Worth%20%20Everything%20You%20Need%20To%20Know%20About%20The%20Chinese-Canadian%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-simu-bio-wiki-career-net-worth-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-chinese-canadian-actor.html&title=Who%20Is%20Simu%3f%20Bio%2fwiki%20Career%20%26amp%3b%20Net%20Worth%20%20Everything%20You%20Need%20To%20Know%20About%20The%20Chinese-Canadian%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-simu-bio-wiki-career-net-worth-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-chinese-canadian-actor.html&description=Who%20Is%20Simu%3f%20Bio%2fwiki%20Career%20%26amp%3b%20Net%20Worth%20%20Everything%20You%20Need%20To%20Know%20About%20The%20Chinese-Canadian%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-plays-augustus-in-percy-jackson-know-everything-about-augustus.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Plays Augustus in Percy Jackson?
