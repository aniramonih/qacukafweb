His wife Tricia is a few years younger than him, and they have an age difference of 10 years.</p><h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Tricia Day</a> has been representing the Street Outlaws: Memphis team on the Discovery Channel for 5 seasons so far, with the team slated to return for a new season.</p><p>Alongside her lifelong friend Precious Cooper and Mallory “Molly” Gulley, the strong team of women racers has been carrying their own weight amongst Tennessee’s street racing elite.</p><p>Tricia Day—who has long gone by the street name Midget, thanks to her diminutive 5-foot frame—has even managed to hold her own when she comes up against the king of the Memphis street racing scene: her husband, JJ Da Boss.</p><p><a href=#>JJ Da Boss and his petite wife</a> have steadily helped their crew amass some impressive victories in high stakes, high octane street racing.</p><p>This dynamic team knows what they’re doing on the track and under the hood—but fans still have questions.</p><p>Like: what is JJ Da Boss and his wife’s age difference?</p><p>How did they meet?</p><p>How many kids do they have?</p><p>We’re unpacking all the answers here.</p><p>For starters, yes. JJ Da Boss really does have 11 kids—but they’re not all to Tricia. Read on for the full story.</p><h2><strong>What is the age difference between JJ Da Boss and his wife?</strong></h2><p><br>JJ Da Boss—who’s real name is Jonathan Day—was born on August 10, 1973, in a tiny 700-person town just outside of Memphis, Tennessee.</p><p>Over a decade later, in 1983, Tricia was born.</p><p>The pair grew up in the same town, but more than 10 years apart, and JJ had already earned a considerable reputation for partying, racing, and making babies. In fact, he already had seven children by the time Tricia started to think about dating him.</p><p>At that stage, the pair were busy living their own lives.</p><p>Tricia was trying to start a career and explore a little of the US. She also had a wild side, and wanted to learn about street racing.</p><p>That’s where JJ came in. He offered to show Tricia the ropes, and the charismatic shortstack fell in love with racing immediately. She never looked back.</p><h2><strong>How did JJ Da Boss meet his wife?</strong></h2><p>While JJ knew early on that he “had a thing for Tricia,” he wasn’t totally sure how he felt about teaching her to race.</p><p>Her early training behind the wheel cost JJ a lot of money, with him admitting that early on, his hot date “tore up a lot of stuff.”</p><p>Looking back, though, the king of the Memphis street racing circuit wouldn’t change it for anything.</p><p>“She saved my life,” he said simply in a season 3 snippet from Street Outlaws: Memphis.</p><h2><strong>How many kids do JJ Da Boss and his wife have?</strong></h2><p><br>From that point on, Tricia and Jonathan were inseparable.</p><p>The couple tied the knot within a year, and welcomed four kids together—three daughters and a son.</p><p>While the pair may have wasted no time in starting their own family, Tricia—aka Midget—is quick to set the record straight.</p><p>“I do not have 11 kids, those guys have their own mamas. I just love to be with them.”</p><h2><strong>Did JJ Da Boss date Precious Cooper?</strong></h2><p>In a nutshell: no.</p><p>When <a href=#>Precious Cooper</a> decided she wanted to be a street racer, she headed to Memphis, Tennessee, to prove to JJ Da Boss that she had the skills to make it work.</p><p>Precious, who was a friend of Tricia’s anyway, asked JJ to be her mentor on the track.</p><p>Day had just been released from prison and was in the midst of negotiating a contract with the Discovery channel when Precious showed up.</p><p>The little pocket rocket with the fiery temper showed passion and loyalty, and the trio stayed close through the births of their kids and their relationships on the track.</p><p>When pressed about what was going on between him and Precious, Jonathan was ready. “We’re friends. Nothing unmoral—she grew up with my wife, and she helps [us].”</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Katherine Creag Net Worth</a></p><h2><strong>Was JJ Da Boss’ wife Tricia Day in a car accident?</strong></h2><p>Yes, she was.</p><p>Fans are used to some of the chaos and carnage they see on Street Outlaws: Memphis, but they weren’t prepared when Tricia “Midget” Day showed up for an episode in a wheelchair.</p><p>Following an outpouring of questions across social media, Tricia got involved to settle things down.</p><p>She explained that the wheelchair was “temporary” and looked worse than it was.</p><p>Downplaying the situation may have been a good move for reassuring fans, but it was far from the truth.</p><p>In fact, Tricia had been involved in a serious car wreck on the race track on January 12, 2022—a wreck that happened when Tricia and JJ collided with each other.</p><p>At the time, JJ tweeted about the traumatic event: “I don’t know if I’ll ever go back to who I was before the accident.”</p><p>During the filming of Street Outlaws: America’s List, it appeared that JJ’s vehicle had caught fire and crossed the center line.</p><p>Here, it hit his wife’s vehicle, pushing her into three minivans of camera crew equipment.</p><p>Midget was moved to hospital, and JJ was checked over at the scene.</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT:</strong> <a href=#>Who is Tracy Romulus’ husband</a>?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaK8tr%2FPnqappJWpvKWt2GeaqKVfn7dusMBmmairo2LEqrLEZpignV2ZtqeyxKucp5uVZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjj-da-boss-wife-age-difference.html&text=What%20is%20the%20age%20difference%20between%20JJ%20Da%20Boss%20and%20his%20wife%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjj-da-boss-wife-age-difference.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjj-da-boss-wife-age-difference.html&title=What%20is%20the%20age%20difference%20between%20JJ%20Da%20Boss%20and%20his%20wife%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjj-da-boss-wife-age-difference.html&title=What%20is%20the%20age%20difference%20between%20JJ%20Da%20Boss%20and%20his%20wife%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjj-da-boss-wife-age-difference.html&title=What%20is%20the%20age%20difference%20between%20JJ%20Da%20Boss%20and%20his%20wife%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjj-da-boss-wife-age-difference.html&description=What%20is%20the%20age%20difference%20between%20JJ%20Da%20Boss%20and%20his%20wife%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-is-the-difference-between-zego-and-inshur.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is the Difference Between Zego and INSHUR">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-is-phil-grucci-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Is Phil Grucci Net Worth?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
