The proceedings have endured two mistrials before embarking on the third trial.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Throughout this third trial, the spotlight has fallen on AJ Armstrong’s siblings, Kayra and Joshua Armstrong.</p><p>Notably, Kayra stood in support of her brother during the trial. While AJ’s defense has previously sought to explore the possibility of Joshua’s involvement in the murders, the adopted son of the Armstrong family has never been summoned to the witness stand.</p><p>Antonio Sr., a former football star at Texas A&M University and an NFL linebacker, notably played for the Miami Dolphins during the 1995-1996 season. Tragically, Dawn was pronounced deceased at the scene after sustaining two gunshot wounds behind her ear.</p><p>Antonio Sr. was transported to Memorial Hermann Hospital with a gunshot wound atop his head, succumbing to his injuries at a later time. The authorities confirmed that the couple was fatally shot using Antonio Sr.’s firearm, reportedly kept within the bottom drawer of his nightstand.</p><p>The trial, which has unfolded over several days, now finds jurors in the process of deliberating whether to pronounce AJ Armstrong guilty of the murder of his parents.</p><h2><strong>Who Are AJ Armstrong Siblings?</strong></h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Among the pivotal players in this narrative are AJ Armstrong’s siblings. Joshua Armstrong, the older half-brother of AJ, initially known for his empathetic nature, underwent a significant transformation following the tragic events of July 29, 2016, when their parents were murdered.</p><p>Based on psychiatric records, there is a suggestion that Joshua might have been a witness to the slayings.</p><p>A notable aspect of the trial’s opening statements involved the defence team’s efforts to highlight Joshua’s potential involvement in the killings of Antonio and Dawn Armstrong.</p><p>The defence argued that Joshua, who demonstrated a history of unsettling behaviour, had access to his parent’s home at the time of the murders. Additionally, it was mentioned that he appeared at the home within moments of the tragic incident.</p><p>While Joshua’s medical records were not admissible during the first trial, his records in the second trial revealed significant insights. These records, in handwritten form, depicted Joshua as schizophrenic, suicidal, and depressive.</p><p>Furthermore, they detailed the traumatic history of witnessing his parents’ murder in 2016. A summary of his voluntary admission for paranoia revealed his disbelief in AJ’s guilt, instead noting that he accused various family members of the crime.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Joshua’s mental breakdown in the aftermath of his parents’ deaths was evident, as he interpreted family members’ statements as veiled threats and exhibited a heightened state of paranoia.</p><p>As the trial progresses, the complex dynamics within the Armstrong family continue to play a central role in the unfolding legal proceedings.</p><h2><strong>Who Is Josh Armstrong?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Josh Armstrong, the older half-brother of AJ Armstrong, has emerged as a central figure in a complex and tragic narrative. Once known for his empathetic nature and passion for music, his life took a drastic turn following a series of harrowing events.</p><p>On July 29, 2016, tragedy struck when Josh’s parents, Dawn and Antonio Armstrong Sr., were brutally murdered.</p><p>This heart-wrenching incident marked a turning point in Josh’s life, leading to a profound disconnection from reality. According to psychiatric records, the trauma of witnessing his parents’ murder may have significantly impacted his mental state.</p><p>Joshua’s involvement came under scrutiny during AJ Armstrong’s trials. The defense argued that Joshua, with access to his parents’ home at the time, exhibited disturbing behavior and arrived at the house shortly after the murders.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Despite these contentions, Joshua’s mental health records were not admissible during the first trial.</p><p>The second trial, however, provided a glimpse into Joshua’s deteriorating mental state. Handwritten medical records revealed his struggles with conditions such as schizophrenia, suicidal thoughts, and depression. The records also highlighted the traumatic event of witnessing his parents’ murders in 2016.</p><h2><strong>AJ Armstrong Parents: What Happened To Them?</strong></h2><p>Dawn and Antonio Armstrong Sr., the parents of AJ Armstrong, are central figures in a tragic and heart-wrenching narrative that has captivated attention due to its devastating impact. Both individuals played significant roles in their family and community before their lives were abruptly cut short.</p><p>Antonio Armstrong Sr., a former football star at Texas A&M University and a seasoned NFL linebacker, left a legacy on and off the field.</p><p>His athletic prowess led him to play for the Miami Dolphins during the 1995-1996 season. Beyond his sporting achievements, he was a father and husband known for his contributions to his family and his community.</p><p>Dawn Armstrong, AJ’s mother, was a presence that extended beyond her role as a spouse and mother. Her life was marked by her dedication to her family and the various roles she undertook within their household. Tragically, Dawn’s life was cut short by an unthinkable act of violence.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>On July 29, 2016, the lives of Dawn and Antonio Sr. were tragically taken when they fell victim to a brutal murder. Their&nbsp; untimely deaths have left an indelible impact on their family, friends, and the wider community.</p><p>This unimaginable loss has served as the backdrop for the legal proceedings involving their son, AJ Armstrong.</p><ul class=td-pulldown-filter-list></ul><a class="td-social-sharing-button td-social-handler td-social-expand-tabs" href=# data-block-uid=tdi_37 title=More><i class="td-icon-plus td-social-expand-tabs-icon"></i></a><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTBmqqeZpOkunCtyWaYq6Wjqb%2BwusZmqqKanJ67qL%2BMppyerF2dtrR5waumraCVp3qru9KhZJqqnajBs7vNoGY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2faj-armstrong-siblings-meet-his-brother-josh-armstrong.html&text=AJ%20Armstrong%20Siblings%3a%20Meet%20His%20Brother%20Josh%20Armstrong&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2faj-armstrong-siblings-meet-his-brother-josh-armstrong.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2faj-armstrong-siblings-meet-his-brother-josh-armstrong.html&title=AJ%20Armstrong%20Siblings%3a%20Meet%20His%20Brother%20Josh%20Armstrong" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2faj-armstrong-siblings-meet-his-brother-josh-armstrong.html&title=AJ%20Armstrong%20Siblings%3a%20Meet%20His%20Brother%20Josh%20Armstrong" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2faj-armstrong-siblings-meet-his-brother-josh-armstrong.html&title=AJ%20Armstrong%20Siblings%3a%20Meet%20His%20Brother%20Josh%20Armstrong" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2faj-armstrong-siblings-meet-his-brother-josh-armstrong.html&description=AJ%20Armstrong%20Siblings%3a%20Meet%20His%20Brother%20Josh%20Armstrong" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./judy-ovitz.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="All About Judy Ovitz, Wife Of Michael Ovitz">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./abigail-breslin-net-worth-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Abigail Breslin Net Worth  How Much is Breslin Worth?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
