I was arrested six times. On probation five times. I was just a wayward teenager. My father was in the Tennessee State Penitentiary for about ten years, and I hated my stepdad … so, I was actually shipped off to a boy’s home, and I became a Christian ten days after I got there.”</p><p>Locke earned a Master’s Degree in Revival History from the Baptist Theological School of New England.
