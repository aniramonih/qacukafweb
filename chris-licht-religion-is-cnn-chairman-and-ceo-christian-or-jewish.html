I. Newhouse School of Public Communications, where he earned a bachelor’s degree in broadcast journalism and political science in 1993.</p><p>Licht’s career trajectory gained momentum when he joined KNBC in Los Angeles, coinciding with the notorious O.J. Simpson trial. He subsequently worked with local NBC affiliates in both the LA and San Francisco markets, honing his skills and gaining valuable experience. In 2005, he took on the role of executive producer for Scarborough Country at MSNBC. Later, Licht and host Joe Scarborough teamed up to create Morning Joe, which successfully launched in 2007.</p><p>2011 marked a pivotal point in Licht’s career as he transitioned to CBS, assuming the role of vice president of programming at CBS News. He quickly made a significant impact as the executive producer of CBS This Morning, revamping the show and catapulting CBS into an unexpectedly competitive position in the morning show race, a feat not achieved in nearly three decades. Under Licht’s leadership, the hosts’ Gayle King, Charlie Rose, and Norah O’Donnell were given the freedom to engage in candid discussions about news events and personal experiences, fostering a unique connection with the audience.</p><p>In 2016, Licht expanded his influence by joining The Late Show with Stephen Colbert as executive producer. He brought his managerial expertise to the show, streamlining operations, and implementing changes that resulted in a surge of viewership. The Late Show experienced its highest weekly audience since February 2016, a testament to Licht’s ability to enhance and invigorate a program.</p><p>The pinnacle of Licht’s career came in February 2022 when he was appointed as the president and CEO of CNN, succeeding the influential Jeff Zucker. Recognizing the erosion of trust in the news media, Licht wasted no time in outlining his vision for CNN in a memo to all employees. He aimed to restore trust by upholding the core principles of journalism—fearlessly speaking truth to power, challenging the status quo, and fostering an environment that encourages diverse perspectives. Licht’s commitment to truth and his desire to reshape CNN’s reputation among Republicans showcased his determination to unite and inform audiences across the political spectrum.</p><p>However, despite his initial vision, Licht faced criticism during his tenure at CNN. In late 2022, the network terminated the contracts of long-time correspondents, including Brian Stelter, John Harwood, and Jeffrey Toobin. The move was seen as an attempt to shift the network’s tone to a less politically charged one, prompting mixed reactions from the public.</p><p>Sadly, Licht’s journey as CNN’s president and CEO was cut short in June 2023. An article in The Atlantic shed light on discontent among employees, leading to his dismissal. While the specifics of the internal issues remain undisclosed, it is clear that Licht faced challenges and obstacles during his time at the helm of CNN.</p><h3><strong>Chris Licht Religion: Is CNN Chairman And CEO Christian or Jewish?</strong></h3><p>Licht is yet to comment on the type of religion he belongs to. Some believe he is Jewish whiles others believe he is a Christian. However, Chris Licht is yet to comment on the subject.</p><ul class=td-pulldown-filter-list></ul><a class="td-social-sharing-button td-social-handler td-social-expand-tabs" href=# data-block-uid=tdi_37 title=More><i class="td-icon-plus td-social-expand-tabs-icon"></i></a><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTBmqqeZpOkunCvx6ugrGWcnrCpwIyrnKWhl568r3nIrGScpp5isKmtyKukmqZdlrulecKepmabmKe2tMDImqVmp6Jit6bDyKyfaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fchris-licht-religion-is-cnn-chairman-and-ceo-christian-or-jewish.html&text=Chris%20Licht%20Religion%3a%20Is%20CNN%20Chairman%20And%20CEO%20Christian%20or%20Jewish%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchris-licht-religion-is-cnn-chairman-and-ceo-christian-or-jewish.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchris-licht-religion-is-cnn-chairman-and-ceo-christian-or-jewish.html&title=Chris%20Licht%20Religion%3a%20Is%20CNN%20Chairman%20And%20CEO%20Christian%20or%20Jewish%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fchris-licht-religion-is-cnn-chairman-and-ceo-christian-or-jewish.html&title=Chris%20Licht%20Religion%3a%20Is%20CNN%20Chairman%20And%20CEO%20Christian%20or%20Jewish%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fchris-licht-religion-is-cnn-chairman-and-ceo-christian-or-jewish.html&title=Chris%20Licht%20Religion%3a%20Is%20CNN%20Chairman%20And%20CEO%20Christian%20or%20Jewish%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchris-licht-religion-is-cnn-chairman-and-ceo-christian-or-jewish.html&description=Chris%20Licht%20Religion%3a%20Is%20CNN%20Chairman%20And%20CEO%20Christian%20or%20Jewish%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./christina-applegate-bittersweet-appearance-twins-with-daughter-sag-awards.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Christina Applegate twins with her daughter during bittersweet red carpet appearance">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./chris-fischer.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chris Fisher, The Husband Of American Actress and Comedian, Amy Fisher/ Know About his Wedding and H">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
