Sal Governale is best known for being a writer and comedian on "The <a href=#>Howard Stern</a> Show."</p><p>Sal, aka "Sal the Stockbroker," was a stockbroker in New York City when he started making frequent call-ins to make fun of <a href=#>Gary Dell'Abate</a>. Governale eventually entered the "Win John's Job" contest on the show. He came in second place, but he was still hired as writer for the show. Sal is known as a prankster, and he is well-known for his crass racial humor on the show and in his stand-up appearances. He denies being a racist, however when he tries to explain why he is not racist, he comes across as being even more racist, as in the infamous "Taped Apology" incident.</p><p>There have been many rumors that Sal was not a real stockbroker but a con-artist who worked for a fly by night company that sold innocent people fake stocks. However, there are no official reports to back these claims up. Governale has been part of the "Killers of Comedy Tour" along with other regulars from Stern's show, such as Reverend Bob Levy, <a href=# title="Richard Christy Net Worth">Richard Christy</a>, <a href=# title="Jim Florentine Net Worth">Jim Florentine</a>, Yucko the Clown, and Shuli. Sal was credited as a writer, director, and producer on the 2006 TV movie "Supertwink" as well as "Howard Stern on Demand" (2006–2007). He also starred in "Supertwink" and has appeared in films such as "Goodbye Baby" (2007), "Circus Maximus" (2010), "Pickaxe" (2014), and "Weedjies: Halloweed Night" (2019).</p><h2 id=sal-governale-salary><strong>Sal Governale Salary</strong></h2><p>Sal Governale's salary is reportedly $80,000 per year.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Sal Governale was born Salvatore C. Governale on October 24, 1968, in New York City. Sal briefly attended Suffolk County Community College, and he initially wanted to become a radiologist. HowardStern.com says of Governale's father, "Many stories have been told about Sal's days growing up with his pizzeria-owning father, but you may not have known the elder Governale actually invented the concept of pizza toppings, the fact that pizzas are served round, and zeppoles (an Italian pastry) among other things … or so Sal's father says."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-157522 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Sal-Governale.jpg alt="Sal Governale" width=594 height=420 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-157522 class=wp-caption-text>Vivien Killilea/Getty Images for SiriusXM</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>"The Smoking Gun" reported that before Sal got involved with "The Howard Stern Show," he "worked for almost four years (January 1990 to October 1993) at American Interconnect, a notorious Long Island telemarketing firm. He claims that his employment there ended on October 1, 1993. A month later, in November 1993, American Interconnect's offices were raided by federal agents as part of a large telephone fraud investigation…Criminal probers charged that American Interconnect ran a fraudulent 'boiler room' operation where employees solicited donations by falsely claiming they were DEA agents and police officers." In 1996, Governale began frequently calling "The Howard Stern Show" to mock Gary Dell'Abate." In 2004, he was runner-up in the "Win John's Job" contest, which he lost to Richard Christy, his future writing partner. Sal was eventually hired to make prank calls and write for "The Howard Stern Show." As an actor, he has guest-starred on "Blue Mountain State" (2011), "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit" (2014), and "Kevin Can Wait" (2018) and appeared in the films "Goodbye Baby" (2007), "Circus Maximus" (2010), "Booley" (2010), "Candy's Room: Soleil Noir" (2011), "Girls Gone Dead" (2012), "Jersey Shore Massacre" (2014), "Pickaxe" (2014), and "Weedjies: Halloweed Night" (2019).</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Sal has been married to his wife, Christine, since February 18, 1996. The couple has three sons, Antonio (born in 1999), Aidan (born in 2001), and Aaron (born in 2003). According to "The Smoking Gun," Governale sued the internet firm Regland, Inc. for $200,000 in 2003 for failing to pay him for plugging the company on "The Howard Stern Show." The company reportedly promised to pay Sal at least $45,000, and Governale didn't tell anyone at the show about the deal. He told "The Smoking Gun," "I get proposals all the time to plug things on the Stern show. Usually, I don't think it's cool…Howard doesn't like it if anyone associated with the show is disloyal, if someone takes advantage of the show. But I think Howard would be cool about this…I didn't think it was a big deal."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6o8HSoqWeq6Oisq971pqjpWWjqb%2BmsdNoqpqkXZy8t7HRp5ilnV2jsrV51qipraBf</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsal-governale-net-worth.html&text=Sal%20Governale%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsal-governale-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsal-governale-net-worth.html&title=Sal%20Governale%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsal-governale-net-worth.html&title=Sal%20Governale%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsal-governale-net-worth.html&title=Sal%20Governale%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsal-governale-net-worth.html&description=Sal%20Governale%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./sean-caribe-avant-jr-missing-found-near-bayview.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sean Caribe Avant Jr Missing Update: Body Found Near Bayview Lake">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jordan-mcgraw.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Phil McGraw's son, Jordan McGraw is Dating His Gilrfriend, Ragan Wallake, a professional photographe">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
