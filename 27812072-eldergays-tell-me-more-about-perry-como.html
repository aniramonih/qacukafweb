They hadn't had a true leading man singer since Nelson Eddy and were hoping to eventually pair him with Judy Garland, June Allyson and others. But after the filming of Words and Music, in which he only sings a couple of numbers and is billed as himself as it's a "bio" of Lorenz Hart, he said something unforgiveable to LB Mayer and they mutually and angrily tore up the contract with no regrets.</p><p>I don't think Perry actually was ever interested in acting and the new medium of television was perfect for allowing him to be his own laid-back self in the laid-back Eisenhower Era. He was famous for being a family man and scandal free. Apparently very beloved and respected in his time.</p><p>I'm old enough (70) to remember his TV show but I was never very interested and far preferred The Garry Moore Show, another variety hour, which was shot in NY and often featured fresh and young Broadway talent and lots more comedy. But I do find myself looking at these old clips and appreciating Perry more now than I did as a child.

He performed on radio from 1936 to 1955 and returned to a regular series in 1989 until his death in 2001.</p><p>Perhaps this quote can make you understand how highly regarded he was in the business:</p><p>"Despite his immense popularity, Como is rarely given credit for what, once you stop and think of it, he so clearly is: one of the great singers and one of the great artists of our time.</p><p>Perhaps the reason people rarely talk about his formidable attributes as a singer is that he makes so little fuss about them. That celebrated ease of his has been too little understood. Ease in any art is the result of mastery over the details of the craft. You get them together to the point where you can forget about how you do things and concentrate on what you are doing. Como got them together so completely that the muscles don't even show. It seems effortless, but a good deal of effort has gone into making it seem so. Como is known to be meticulous about rehearsal of the material for an album. He tries things out in different keys, gives the song thought, makes suggestions, tries it again, and again, until he is satisfied. The hidden work makes him look like Mr. Casual, and too many people are taken in by it—but happily so."</p><p>—Gene Lees, sleeve note, Look To Your Heart</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 90</td><td class=timestamp><span>January 24, 2021 7:27 PM</span></td></tr></table><p>The great Eugene Levy in SCTV's take on Perry -</p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Offsite Link</a><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 92</td><td class=timestamp><span>January 24, 2021 7:42 PM</span></td></tr></table><p>Perry Como was Andy Williams without the murderer wife.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 93</td><td class=timestamp><span>January 24, 2021 7:51 PM</span></td></tr></table><p>[quote]there was certainly longevity in Perry Como's career.</p><p>He is totally forgotten today and even my 60-something aunts and uncles think he's prehistoric.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 94</td><td class=timestamp><span>January 24, 2021 8:00 PM</span></td></tr></table><p>[quote] I can guarantee you that none of that Sinatra music, though good, translates to any but the very few born after 1970.</p><p>I know lots of people younger than that (myself included) who like Sinatra.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 95</td><td class=timestamp><span>January 24, 2021 8:00 PM</span></td></tr></table><p>Your 60-something aunts and uncles were toddlers or weren't even born yet when Perry was the top entertainment figure in TV and national entertainment, r94, so they'd hardly be fair judges concerning his 70+ year career.,</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 96</td><td class=timestamp><span>January 24, 2021 8:03 PM</span></td></tr></table><p>The point is he's totally forgotten today r96.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 97</td><td class=timestamp><span>January 24, 2021 8:04 PM</span></td></tr></table><p>R95, you also know lots of people younger than yourself who like Frankie Laine.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 98</td><td class=timestamp><span>January 24, 2021 8:09 PM</span></td></tr></table><p>Nope r98.</p><p>WTF is it with you elders that you can't accept that certain entertainers from your youth are no longer relevant or known to the general population?

His career then took a nosedive, but he came back winning an Oscar for "From Here To Eternity". He stayed relevant in the Sixties with hit records like "My Way", "Strangers In The Night" and "New York, New York", as well as a huge hit duet with daughter Nancy, "Something Stupid".
