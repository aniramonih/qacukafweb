However, his life turned around after one of his students nominated him for the renowned <a href=#>TV series </a><i>MasterChef.</i> Ben Milbourne brother, Grant Milbourne, had auditioned in 2014 but did not get the role.</p><p class=align-left>Upon joining the <i>MasterChef</i>, he became the heartthrob of the show.

He was eliminated over <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">a sour salmon</a>, which the judges considered acidic and inedible. The chef had prepared a BBQ salmon fillet with charred spring onions, kale, walnut cream, sauce, and vierge using a difficult-to-cook cut of salmon collars, but his fish was too acidic.</p><p class=align-left>Are Ben and Andy still friends? Yes, they are. Since his best friend, Andy was one of the judges who eliminated him, people have always been curious to know their current relationship status. Even though they were best friends, Andy was an honest, reliable, and trustworthy person who judged his dish without bias.</p><h3>Ben Milbourne wife and children</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/61f9181c48cbf406.jpg><p class=align-left>The chef is married to his long-term girlfriend Sally.
