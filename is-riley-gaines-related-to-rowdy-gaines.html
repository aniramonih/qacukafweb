The public is curious to figure out the relationship between the two professional swimmers.&nbsp;</p><p>Riley Gaines, 23, is a former college swimmer who used to swim for the University of Kentucky team. Rowdy Gaines, 64, is a former competitive swimmer and a three-time gold medalist.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vizaca.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Riley-Gaines.png><p>The two swimmers have no similarities with each other except for their nicknames. Contrary to popular belief, the nature of Riley and Rowdy’s relationship is entirely professional.&nbsp;</p><p>Although both people in question belong to the swimming fraternity, Rowdy Gaines retired from swimming well before Riley was even born.</p><p>Riley Gaines came into the spotlight after protestors at the San Franciso State University attacked her. The attackers were LGBTQ+ and trans supporters.&nbsp;</p><p>Gaines was invited to the university to attend a Turning Point USA event. The protestors chased and ambushed Riley before the event started. The attackers chanted, ‘Trans rights are human rights, and trans women are women.’</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vizaca.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Former-University-of-Kentucky-swimmer-Riley-Gaines-speaks-during-a-rally-on-Thursday-Jan.-12-2023-outside-the-NCAA-Convention-in-San-Antonio.-AP-Photo-Darren-Abate.png><p>On April 7th, the victim posted a video clip on Twitter showing the ordeal she had to go through. The caption of her post called San Francisco State University an asylum and the people who study their prisoners.&nbsp;</p><p>She added that she was physically attacked by a man two times. However, Riley chose to focus on the positive side of the horrible experience. She said the attack was proof that what she was doing was right.</p><p>The attack was a source of <a href=#>motivation</a> for Gaines to expand her stance further.&nbsp;</p><p>The incident that took place at San Francisco State University highlights the lack of s*x-protected spaces for women.&nbsp;</p><p>Riley Gaines came on the radar of trans people after her stance regarding the participation of trans women in women’s sports competitions came to light.&nbsp;</p><p>A year ago, Gaines competed with transgender Lia Thomas in a freestyle swim competition. Both of them tied for fifth place, but Gaines started objecting to the participation of trans women in women’s sports competitions.</p><p>She said tha only ‘biological women’ should be allowed to take part in such competitions. To support her stance, Gaines added that the build of a transgender woman is much different from that of a biological woman.&nbsp;</p><p>This gives them an undue advantage in swimming competitions. Moreover, Gaines highlighted the time when Lia Thomas “exposed male genitalia” in a women’s locker room during the NCAA championship.</p><p>She said she was traumatized upon seeing Lia change in a women’s locker room and requested NCAA establish a separate locker room for transgender athletes.&nbsp;</p><p>Since then, Riley has repeatedly gone to universities and colleges to educate more people about this issue, and has become quite popular.&nbsp;</p><p>Riley Gaines’ stance against transgender athletes has landed her in hot water over and over again.&nbsp;</p><p>She has repeatedly been questioned regarding her extreme stances, but she has never shied away from openly accepting what she believes in.&nbsp;</p><p>Gaines strongly believes in preserving the integrity of one-gender sports, and fortunately for her, she is not alone in this fight.&nbsp;</p><p>While trans supporters see her as transphobic, she defends herself by saying that it’s her right to speak about what makes her uncomfortable.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Exploring Riley Gaines family life</h2><p>Whenever one thinks about the former swimmer’s family, the first question that comes to mind is, ‘Is Riley Gaines related to Rowdy Gaines?</p><p>Anyone who thought Riley is Rowdy’s daughter is mistaken. The former swimmers could only be linked to each other in a professional manner and nothing more than that.&nbsp;</p><p>Rowdy Gaines is the proud father of four children, none of whom is Riley Gaines.&nbsp;</p><p>Brad and Telisha Gaines are the parents of Riley Gaines, a former college swimmer for the University of Kentucky team.</p><p>Riley Gaines’s father is equally, if not more, athletic than her, and he has four SEC championships to his name.&nbsp;</p><p>Brad Gaines played football for the Vanderbilt University team, while Riley’s mother, Telisha, played softball for the Austin Peay.&nbsp;</p><p>It appears that Riley got the motivation to become an athlete from both of her parents. Her strength and skills could be attributed to her athletic genes.&nbsp;</p><p>Swimming has played a really important role in Riley’s life; after all, she also met her husband through the sport.&nbsp;</p><p>Riley Gaines husband is Louis Barker. Riley also changed her last name to Barker to prove her love for her husband.&nbsp;</p><p>Louis Barker is also a professional swimmer. The couple seems to keep their relationship out of the public’s eye.&nbsp;</p><p>No statement came from Louis’ side after Riley was ambushed at the San Franciso State University. Riley Gaines’s husband has rarely spoken in her favor publicly.</p><p>Riley announced her marriage to the world in an <a href=#>Instagram</a> post with a picture from her wedding day. The caption of the post contained immense love for Barker and how proud Riley is to call him her husband for life.&nbsp;</p><p>Contrary to popular belief, Rowdy Gaines is not Riley Gaines’s Father. Rowdy got married to Judy Gaines in 1989, and the couple has four beautiful children together.&nbsp;</p><p>The answer to the question, ‘Is Riley Gaines related to Rowdy Gaines’ is a no.&nbsp;</p><p>Except for having the same last name and profession, Riley and Rowdy’s family background is highly dissimilar.&nbsp;</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC10mapoqSVrnqorcinnKxlopq5osDEnWStp12nvLiw2GaemqGemsBw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fis-riley-gaines-related-to-rowdy-gaines.html&text=Is%20Riley%20Gaines%20Related%20To%20Rowdy%20Gaines%3f%20The%20Relationship%20Explored&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-riley-gaines-related-to-rowdy-gaines.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-riley-gaines-related-to-rowdy-gaines.html&title=Is%20Riley%20Gaines%20Related%20To%20Rowdy%20Gaines%3f%20The%20Relationship%20Explored" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fis-riley-gaines-related-to-rowdy-gaines.html&title=Is%20Riley%20Gaines%20Related%20To%20Rowdy%20Gaines%3f%20The%20Relationship%20Explored" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fis-riley-gaines-related-to-rowdy-gaines.html&title=Is%20Riley%20Gaines%20Related%20To%20Rowdy%20Gaines%3f%20The%20Relationship%20Explored" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-riley-gaines-related-to-rowdy-gaines.html&description=Is%20Riley%20Gaines%20Related%20To%20Rowdy%20Gaines%3f%20The%20Relationship%20Explored" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./is-scuttle-a-boy-or-girl.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is scuttle a boy or girl?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./is-mampintsha-sick-what-happened-to-mampintsha.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Mampintsha Sick?
