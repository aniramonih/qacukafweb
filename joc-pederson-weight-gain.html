His unique fit with family at the All-Star Game that first aired on NBC Sports Bay Area has made an impression even before stepping onto the field at Dodger Stadium.</strong></p><p><strong>Joc Russell Pederson</strong> (born April 21, 1992) is an American Major League Baseball <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>outfielder</a></strong> for the San Francisco Giants. He was previously with the Los Angeles Dodgers, Chicago Cubs, and Atlanta Braves. He has two World Series titles and two All-Star appearances.</p><p>Pederson is the son of <strong>Shelly</strong> and <strong>Stu Pederson</strong> and was born in Palo Alto, California. Tyger, Joc's older brother is also a baseball player. Champ, Joc's eldest brother, has Down syndrome and occasionally stays with him during the season. Jacey, his younger sister, is an elite national amateur soccer player.</p><p>Pederson was second in career home run frequency (behind <strong>Hank Greenberg</strong>) and ninth in career home runs (behind <strong>Kevin Youkilis</strong> and <strong>Mike Lieberthal</strong>) through 2021 among Jewish baseball players (behind <strong>Sid Gordon</strong>). Pederson graduated from Palo Alto High School. Pederson received his diploma in 2010.</p><p>Joc Pederson of the San Francisco Giants hasn't played in the <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>MLB</a></strong> All-Star Game in seven years, but he was already making an impression before even taking the field at Dodger Stadium. The Pedersons know how to make an entrance, and they did just that at the 2022 All-Star Game red carpet.</p><p>Joc walked the red carpet with his wife <strong>Kelsey</strong>, two children, and beloved brother <strong>Champ</strong>, wearing an epic two-piece set topped with a white blazer. His appearance has led fans to wonder if he has gained weight. Here is everything you need to know about Joc Pederson's weight gain.</p><p>Previously, we touched on the <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>weight gain</a></strong> efforts of <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Leonard Fournette</a></strong> and <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Tyra Banks</a></strong>.</p><h2>Joc Pederson Weight Gain: How Much Did He Weigh?</h2><p><strong>Joc Pederson</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@yungjoc650</a>) weighs approximately <strong>100 kg. </strong>Being an athlete, he has a good-looking physique. Although, internet users are searching to know about Joc Pederson's weight gain, he does not appear to have gained weight.</p><p>His current appearance is the same as it was previously. Similarly, when comparing his <a href=# rel=noopener>before</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>after</a> photos, he doesn't appear to be gaining much weight.</p><p>The 30-year-old athlete is extremely positive and self-aware about his physical health. Although many fans have searched the internet for Joc Pederson's weight gain, there is no evidence that he has gained weight.</p><p>It's worth noting Joc hasn't gained significant weight since becoming a professional basketball player. Pederson has always maintained a healthy weight.</p><h2>Who Is the Wife of Joc Pederson?</h2><p><strong>Joc Pederson and Kelsey Pederson</strong> have been <a href=# rel=noopener>married</a> since January 2018. Joc and Kelsey dated for several years before tying the knot. Joc and Kelsey were longtime friends, both from the San Francisco Bay Area.</p><p>They reportedly started dating in 2015 and married in 2018 in front of 250 guests. The wedding ceremony, held at Villa Sevillano in Santa Barbara, California, was very modern and included all of Joc and Kelsey's longtime family friends.</p><p>Indeed, the MLB player and Kelsey have two young children: a daughter named <strong>Poppy</strong> and an infant son whose name has not yet been made public.</p><p>Kelsey was born on June 22, 1993, and attended Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, where she was a setter for the Blue Devils' women's volleyball team. The athlete earned a psychology degree from Duke.</p><p>In 2015, she also worked as an assistant volleyball coach for a short time. Despite keeping her personal life relatively lowkey (she has no public social media pages), Kelsey rose to prominence when her relationship with Joc became public.</p><h2>Pham Got No Regrets, Slapping Joc Pederson!</h2><p><strong>Tommy Pham</strong> has no qualms about <a href=# rel=noopener>dishing out the slap</a> heard around the world. On May 27, 2022, the outspoken Cincinnati Reds outfielder slapped San Francisco Giants outfielder <strong>Joc Pederson</strong> over a fantasy football feud, creating one of MLB's most memorable moments. Pham's decision remains unchanged three weeks later.</p><p>The unprovoked front-hand blow was the result of a disagreement over the rules of a fantasy football league in which both players participated. Pham thought Pederson was cheating by putting players on injured reserve, but Pederson saw the move as legal. The MLB appears to have sided with Pederson, suspending Pham for three games and fining him <strong>$5,000.</strong></p><p>However, the penalty could have been far harsher. Pham claimed that immediately following the altercation, the Giants threatened to file assault charges against him and even boycott the game. MLB eventually intervened, threatening the 34-year-old with an 8-10 game suspension if he chose to contest the three-game suspension. Pham chose the latter.</p><p>On the other hand, Pham told that he was bothered by the way Giants players and coaches interjected themselves into his dispute with Pederson. In fact, before joining the Giants, the outfielder stated that he wanted to slap Pederson.</p><p>Pham attempted to catch Pederson while facing the Braves, Pederson's former team, in September of last season, but the 30-year-old never took the field.</p><p><strong>Visit <a href=#>House & Whips</a> for more <a href=#>interesting stories</a> about your favorite celebs.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6rApq3Nna6hoaCoe6S7zGihqJtdpbKlsdGspqdlp5q2qLTTZp6aoZ5k</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjoc-pederson-weight-gain.html&text=Joc%20Pederson%27s%20Weight%20Gain%20Queries%3a%20What%27s%20the%20Tea%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjoc-pederson-weight-gain.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjoc-pederson-weight-gain.html&title=Joc%20Pederson%27s%20Weight%20Gain%20Queries%3a%20What%27s%20the%20Tea%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjoc-pederson-weight-gain.html&title=Joc%20Pederson%27s%20Weight%20Gain%20Queries%3a%20What%27s%20the%20Tea%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjoc-pederson-weight-gain.html&title=Joc%20Pederson%27s%20Weight%20Gain%20Queries%3a%20What%27s%20the%20Tea%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjoc-pederson-weight-gain.html&description=Joc%20Pederson%27s%20Weight%20Gain%20Queries%3a%20What%27s%20the%20Tea%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./joe-crawford-net-worth-income-salary-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Joe Crawford Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jennifer-hudson-christmas-makeover-look-at-those-nails.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jennifer Hudson enchants with unexpected makeover - and look at those nails!">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
