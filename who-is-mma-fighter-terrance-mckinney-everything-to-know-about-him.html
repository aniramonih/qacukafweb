Terrance McKinney won UFC 263 with just two punches and seven seconds.</p><p>The battle was so brief that commentator Joe Rogan hadn’t finished saying how much Frevola enjoys fighting and “doesn’t really flinch away from the wild exchange” when the 30-year-old found himself on his back, looking up at the ceiling.</p><p>His post-fight celebration then went horribly wrong. McKinney hoisted himself onto the cage, pushed off, and fell on his knee. The impact’s effect was instantaneous, as he sank to the canvas on his good knee and took the weight off of it.</p><p>McKinney’s knee injury isn’t a huge problem because he’s been through a lot in his young life. Unbelievably, he came dangerously near to death some years ago after fighting police and getting tasered numerous times while “out of his mind” on a narcotic combination.</p><p>Terrance McKinney has established a reputation as a fighter who dispatches his opponents quickly. He defeated his opponent in the opening round in 10 of his 11 victories.</p><p>His most recent victory, only eight days ago, was the longest of his three in 2021, lasting just over a minute. His last two battles were 16 and 17 seconds long.</p><p>The Youngster won over the Internet after coming a long distance and totally demolished his opponent in a matter of seconds, with some of the best fighters congratulating him on Twitter.</p><h2 id=some-facts-about-terrance-mckinney-that-you-did-not-know><span class=ez-toc-section id=some-facts-about-terrance-mckinney-that-you-did-not-know></span> Some facts about Terrance Mckinney that you did not know<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Here are some Terrance Mckinney facts you may not have known:</p><ul><li>Earlier than deciding to become an MMA fighter, he worked in construction.

Johnson, was also raped at the age of 16 and she gave birth to McKinney while he still had the umbilical chord wrapped around his neck.</p><p>After consuming LSD, psilocybin mushrooms, and alcohol over the summer of 2015, McKinney became very disoriented, and the companions he was celebrating with contacted the authorities and left the area. McKinney was taken to the hospital after being discovered by police covered in blood (after using a piece of glass to slash his neck).</p><p>Although he was twice revived, his heartrate stopped twice while he was in the ambulance. McKinney led the Youth Police Initiative as an act of gratitude to the cops who saved his life. As of now has an astounding fight record of 11 victories, 4 defeats, and 0 draws in his career.</p><h2 id=terrance-mckinney-started-his-career-at-a-young-age><span class=ez-toc-section id=terrance-mckinney-started-his-career-at-a-young-age></span> Terrance McKinney Started His Career At A Young Age<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>McKinney’s family relocated to a military base in Germany when he was a child.
