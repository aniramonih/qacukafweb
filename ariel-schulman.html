He is renowned for his work as a Producer, Director, and Star in the 2010 documentary <i>Catfish, </i>as a Director of <i>Paranormal Activity 3, Paranormal Activity 4, Nerve, and Project Power,</i> and as a Star in<i> Project Power</i> with <strong>Henry Joost.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The handsome actor is also recognized as the older brother of Nev Schulman, the host of the 2010 MTV show <i>Catfish: The TV Show</i>. Let's know more about Ariel Schulman's life.&nbsp;</p><h2>Does Ariel Schulman Have a Girlfriend or a Wife?</h2><p>Ariel Schulman has not married. Until recently, nothing is known about his dating status or his girlfriend. He usually remains under the radar of the media. In the meanwhile, <strong>Nev Schulman</strong> is married to his beautiful wife, <strong>Laura Perlongo</strong>. On <i>July 22, 2017</i>, the couple married. <strong>Cleo James</strong> (born <i>October 21, 2016</i>) and <strong>Beau Bobby Bruce</strong> are their children (born on <i>January 9, 2019</i>).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2021/9/23/22279621_10155558026973280_7429593597721119393_n-min%20(1)-1632418016467.jpg><p>As a result, there is no data available regarding his dating life. He is now concentrating on his profession. <a href=# rel=nofollow>Tom Hanks</a> is one of the hard-working actors in Hollywood.</p><h2>Ariel Schulman's Net worth</h2><p>Ariel Schulman's online worth in 2021 was estimated to be about <strong>$7 million</strong>. That is the result of his efforts throughout his vigorous years, which date back to 2004. The majority of his wealth was earned via his work as a documentary filmmaker and producer.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2021/9/23/65778847_2346937592243728_6578897620697479065_n-min%20(1)-1632418151564.jpg><p>Schulman's brother Nev Schulman <a href=# rel=nofollow>has a net worth</a> of <strong>$500,000.</strong> Nev is the presenter of MTV's <i>Catfish: The TV Show</i>. While Ariel Schulman's salary at MTV is unknown, we discovered that he earns a living as an actor via several means. His last short appearance was in Household Tree. As far as his salary income is concerned, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Bob Saget</a> surely generates good money from his profession as a stand-up comedian.&nbsp;</p><h3>Ariel Schulman And Henry Joost</h3><p>Ariel Schulman, Normally, the summer blockbuster season would be coming to an end. Which films flopped, which soared, and which sneaked into the discussion apparently out of nowhere by now. Box-office figures would have decided who had a job and who didn't, which franchises perished and which survived for another sequel, and, in many respects, what the future of movies could look like.&nbsp;</p><p>Without that weekly gauge of moviegoing appetites, the Netflix Top 10 has come to fill the void, basically telling us which movies are the most popular in the nation. That distinction went to <i>Project Power</i> this past weekend, a sci-fi action film blends the superhero genre and spits it out as an on-the-ground criminal thriller set in New Orleans.</p><p><i>Project Power</i> starring <strong>Jamie Foxx, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Dominique Fishback</strong>, imagines a world in which an illicit drug may create superpowers for five minutes at a time, with one catch. The taker has no idea what their gift (or, in some instances, curse) is until they take it.<i> Project Power</i>, directed by Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost, the filmmaking team behind <i>Catfish</i>, two Paranormal Activity sequels, and 2016's underappreciated thriller Nerve, is pure comfort food at a time when CGI-enhanced thrills are few. In the video below, Schulman and Joost explain how they made it all happen to their buddy <strong>Nicolas Heller,</strong> the documentarian and Instagram sensation New York Nico.</p><h2>Wiki-Bio</h2><p>Ariel Schulman was born Marek Ariel Schulman in New York City, New York, on October 2, 1981. As for his age, he is 40 years old right now.&nbsp;</p><p>The hard-working actor has a TV presenter and producer brother Nev Schulman. He grew up in a Jewish household. He is an American citizen with German, Russian, Polish, and Romanian ancestors.
