It is hard to say</strong></h2><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-65321 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Is-Morgan-Freeman-a-Christian.jpg.webp alt="Is Morgan Freeman a Christian" width=1200 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Is-Morgan-Freeman-a-Christian.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-1 data-svg=1 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-65321 class=wp-caption-text>@Getty</p><p>One of the most interesting insights into Freeman’s career is his versatility.</p><p>He has been someone who has managed to play just about every kind of person you could.</p><p>From comedic roles to taking on more serious roles to playing police detectives, Freeman has been there and done it all.</p><p>It would be hard to find a kind of individual that he has not played, but one of his most recurring roles has been that of God himself.</p><p>You would assume that to return to such a role so regularly that he must have some kind of faith.</p><p>In the past, Freeman spoke of his interesting views on whether or not there even is a God.</p><p>In a discussion about God (which, given his acting roles in the past, seems a logical discussion point), Freeman <a href=# rel=noopener>said</a>: “It’s a hard question because, as I said at the start, I think we invented God. So, if I believe in God, and I do, it’s because I think I’m God.”</p><h2><strong>Has Morgan Freeman’s career changed his views on religion?</strong></h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-65323 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/morgan-freeman-atheist.jpg.webp alt="morgan freeman atheist" width=1200 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/morgan-freeman-atheist.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-2 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-65323 class=wp-caption-text>@Getty</p><p>An interesting topic that has come up has been regarding his career choices.</p><p>Having worked on The Story of God with Morgan Freeman, a role he was arguably chosen for due to his prolific playing of the deity, Freeman was asked if his views on religion and God had changed as he explored his program. However, he said that his views on religion did not shift because he took part in the show.</p><p>So, is Morgan Freeman a Christian?</p><p>No, he is not.</p><p>Freeman’s religion is very much different from what one would expect.</p><p>The fact he has worked on so many different religious-based contents would often mean that the views of the individual shift.</p><p>It is only natural that working around one specific topic on such a regular basis would bring about a sense of change in thinking.</p><p>If you were to surround yourself with one topic for so many years, it would only be expected that you might find your belief system shifting to adapt. However, Freeman’s religious mind has not been shifted simply because he took on the role of God on more than a few occasions.</p><h2><strong>What religion does Morgan Freeman follow, then?</strong></h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-65324 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/is-morgan-freeman-religious.jpg.webp alt="is morgan freeman religious" width=850 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/is-morgan-freeman-religious.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-3 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-65324 class=wp-caption-text>@Getty</p><p>However, his actual religion is not that of Christianity: he is a Zoroastrian.</p><p>In the past, Freeman was clear that this was his chosen religion.</p><p>He <a href=# rel=noopener>spoke about the topic</a> on the YouTube channel Iranian Renaissance.</p><p>It is a highly intriguing video and explains his reasons for seeing Zoroastrian thinking as the religion that ties in best with what he believes in.</p><p>For many, that might seem odd: for an American man to fall in with an Iranian religion. However, when one examines the thought process behind this religion, it is easy to see how it pairs up with the various comments made by Freeman on the topic across his career.</p><h2><strong>What is Zoroastrianism, the religion that Morgan Freeman follows?</strong></h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-65325 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/morgan-freeman-religion.jpg.webp alt="morgan freeman religion" width=900 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw -
