So far he has released four albums, with the most successful being the “Stop All the World Now” (2003), which achieved gold status in the US. His career started in 1998.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Howie Day is, as of early 2017? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Day’s net worth is as high as $2 million, an amount earned through his successful career as a musician.</p><h3>Howie Day Net Worth $2 Million</h3><p>Although born in Bangor, Howie grew up in Brewer, Maine. From an early age, Howie was introduced to music, as his mother bought him a piano at an auction. Little by little Howie’s interest increased, and also his talents came to show, as he was able to reproduce the music he heard on TV or radio. For the next six years Howie played piano, but then in his early teens switched his focus to rock music, and the electric guitar. He took Fender Stratocaster in his hands, a present from his father, and also began taking basic vocal training. During his high school days, Howie would often perform at his family’s restaurant, and soon his name was heard throughout Bangor, and he gave an official performance at restaurant Captain Nick’s.</p><p>He then played in the rock band Route 66, and made several solo appearances, until he was spotted by talent agent <a href=#>Shawn Radley</a>, who took Day under his wing and secured him a 45 days long tour, which almost got him kicked out of school in his senior year. Nevertheless, a budding musician, it was only a matter of time before Howie would have his first recording, and that happened in 1998 with the release of a demo entitled “Howie Day”. Two more EPs followed, “The White EP #1”, and “The White EP #2” in the same year, and two years later, Howie released his first full-length album, “Australia”; self-financed and independently released, it received Best Debut Album Award from Boston Music Awards. For the second album, Howie moved to London and teamed up with Martin Glover, bassist of the rock band Killing Joke, to produce the album. He formed a band consisting of such musicians as Les Hall, Laurie Jenkins and Simon Jones, and recorded the 11-track album “Stop All the World Now”, which reached No. 46 on the Billboard 200 chart, and achieved gold status in the US, increasing his net worth to a large degree.</p><p>For the next three years, Howie toured extensively, increasing his net worth through sell-out concerts and album sales, and then returned to the studio to work on his third album. Before its release, Howie recorded another EP entitled “Be There” (2009), soon enough followed by the album “Sound the Alarm” the same year.</p><p>He continued with tours, but also worked on his new album, and in 2014 started the Pledge Music campaign to support recording and release of his fourth album. Eventually, it was released in 2015 under the title “Lanterns”, initially only to pledgers, but through iTunes it was made available for everyone on the 28th April 2015. As it was released independently it wasn’t charted, however, his fan base gave positive critiques to his most recent release.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Howie is known for his high-profile relationship with singer <a href=#>Britney Spears</a>, with whom he was romantically involved in 2007, and also for dating actress Ashley Brin from 2005 to 2006.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/networthpost.org/wp-content/themes/net-worth/images/celebrity_net_worth.png><h3 class=toggle-head>Soundtrack <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=soundtrack readability=22><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>Miracles from Heaven</td><td>2016</td><td>performer: "Collide" / writer: "Collide"</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=4><td>So You Think You Can Dance</td><td>2010-2011</td><td>TV Series performer -
