He is a young actor, having just started his career, so let’s now focus on his biography, starting from his early years.</p><h2><span id=Diego_Tinoco_Wiki-_Age_Childhood_and_Education>Diego Tinoco Wiki- Age, Childhood, and Education</span></h2><p>Diego Tinoco was born on the 25th November 1997 in Anaheim, California USA, of Mexican ancestry from his father’s side, and Columbian through his mother; Diego grew up in his hometown next to his older brother, whose name he hasn’t mentioned. In his early years, Diego was diagnosed with vitiligo, a disease that causes the skin to lose color on certain areas of the body, because of which he was bullied by his peers and school children, and to avoid the comments, he would wear shirts with sleeves even when it was hot outside.</p><p>He went to El Segundo High School, and would hang out with kids who wouldn’t bug him.</p><h2><span id=Career_Beginnings>Career Beginnings</span></h2><p>Diego has been interested in acting from an early age, and the first time he tried to become a professional actor was when he was just 11 years old, going to Los Angeles for an audition, however, he was sadly out of luck. Nevertheless, he didn’t give up and returned to Los Angeles five years later, and this time landed his first role, as Marco in the short film “Drizzle of Hope” (2015).<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.org///marriedbiography.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-asset-683x1024.jpeg></p><p>The following year Diego secured a minor role in the TV fantasy-drama series “Teen Wolf”, continuing to secure roles, and in 2017 portrayed Diego in the short film “Welcome to Valhalla” (2017).</p><h2><span id=Rise_to_Stardom>Rise to Stardom</span></h2><p>As young Diego was improving, more casting directors heard about him, and in 2018 he landed his career role, selected for the part of Cesar Diaz, an intelligent teen who is forced into gang life in the teen comedy-drama series “On My Block”.</p><p>Since the first episode, Diego is one of four stars to appear in all 28 episodes, next to Brett Gray, Jason Genao and Sierra Capri. The series became an immediate success, winning the Teen Award as the Choice TV Breakout Show, launching Diego to stardom. Diego himself received two nominations, including the Imagen Award nomination in the category for Best Actor- Television. He is currently working on the thriller film “Mourning War”, in which he will have the lead role.</p><h2><span id=Diego_Tinoco_Net_Worth_Height_Weight_and_Appearance>Diego Tinoco Net Worth, Height, Weight, and Appearance</span></h2><p>Diego Tinoco is a rising star, and is steadily adding a considerable amount to his wealth. According to authoritative sources, Diego’s net worth is estimated to be around $360,000 as of early 2020. One of his worthy possessions is a BMW 440i Gran Coupe Sedan, which is valued &nbsp;at roughly $60,000.</p><p>Diego stands at 5ft 7ins (1.7m) tall, weighs approximately 165lbs ~ 75kg, and his vital statistics are 37-34-36. He has dark brown hair and brown eyes.</p><h2><span id=Diego_Tinoco_Personal_Life_Dating_Girlfriend>Diego Tinoco Personal Life, Dating, Girlfriend</span></h2><p>Diego doesn’t like to speak much about his personal life, but has talked about his previous relationship. He said that he dated a girl before he secured the role in “On My Block”, but once he moved to Los Angeles permanently, he broke-up with the mysterious girl, as he was too busy to manage a career and love life.</p><p>However, while he was making contacts in the acting world, he became good friends with actress Isabella Gomez.</p><p>The two were seen together one too many times, enough to spark a rumor of them dating. Nevertheless, when asked about the nature of their relationship, Diego didn’t deny romance but also didn’t confirm it. For now, he remains single and focused on his career.</p><h2><span id=Diego_Tinoco_News_Facts>Diego Tinoco News, Facts</span></h2><p>Diego has become a star in recent years and he has been sought for interviews by a number of popular magazines and publications. Most recently, he <a rel=nofollow href=#>spoke with TeenVogue about coronavirus</a> and how he handles the entire situation.</p><p>Furthermore, he has also <a rel=nofollow href=#>talked about his career and new projects</a> with DigitalJournal.</p><p>Diego is a fan of skateboarding, and in his youth would spend a lot of time on his board and now can do a number of tricks, such as spin around, and skate off a railing, among others.</p><p>Diego’s stardom on screen has also transferred to social media platforms, and he now has over 2.5 million followers on his <a rel=nofollow href=#>official Instagram page</a>.</p>, <a href=#>Wikipedia</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDm6Con6KWvanFjaipoGeUnrKou4ytoKenk6TAbq3KmmScnaOWv26wyJqxZqeeYryvecyyZJukn5i4bq3GnmShnZmctbV7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdiego-tinocos-aka-cesar-diaz-on-on-my-block-age-height.html&text=Diego%20Tinoco%27s%20%28aka%20Cesar%20Diaz%20on%20%27On%20My%20Block%27%29%20Age%2c%20Height&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdiego-tinocos-aka-cesar-diaz-on-on-my-block-age-height.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdiego-tinocos-aka-cesar-diaz-on-on-my-block-age-height.html&title=Diego%20Tinoco%27s%20%28aka%20Cesar%20Diaz%20on%20%27On%20My%20Block%27%29%20Age%2c%20Height" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdiego-tinocos-aka-cesar-diaz-on-on-my-block-age-height.html&title=Diego%20Tinoco%27s%20%28aka%20Cesar%20Diaz%20on%20%27On%20My%20Block%27%29%20Age%2c%20Height" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdiego-tinocos-aka-cesar-diaz-on-on-my-block-age-height.html&title=Diego%20Tinoco%27s%20%28aka%20Cesar%20Diaz%20on%20%27On%20My%20Block%27%29%20Age%2c%20Height" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdiego-tinocos-aka-cesar-diaz-on-on-my-block-age-height.html&description=Diego%20Tinoco%27s%20%28aka%20Cesar%20Diaz%20on%20%27On%20My%20Block%27%29%20Age%2c%20Height" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./gillian-x-files.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Expectant Gillian Anderson promotes X-Files movie">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./did-dan-sleep-with-rachel.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Did Dan sleep with Rachel?
