Allison and Graham Wardle were married for roughly three years. They had a quiet wedding in 2015 and dissolved the marriage in 2018. The former couple kept their relationship away from the media, and since their divorce, Allison has been able to keep things that way.</p><h3><b>&nbsp;Summary of Allison Wardle’s Biography</b></h3><ul><li><b>Full name: </b>Allison Wardle</li><li><b>Gender: Female</b></li><li><b>Date of birth:&nbsp;</b>1980</li><li><strong>Allison Wardle’s Age:</strong> 43 years old</li><li><b>Ethnicity:&nbsp;</b>Caucasian</li><li><b>Nationality:&nbsp;</b>Canadian</li><li><b>Sexual Orientation:&nbsp;</b>Straight</li><li><b>Religion:&nbsp;</b>Christianity</li><li><b>Marital Status:&nbsp;</b>Divorced</li><li><strong>Allison Wardle’s Ex-</strong><b>Husband:&nbsp;</b>Graham Wardle</li><li><strong>Allison Wardle’s </strong><b>Height in Inches:&nbsp;</b>5 feet 5 inches</li><li><b><strong>Allison Wardle’s</strong> Height in Centimetres: </b>165 cm</li><li><strong>Allison Wardle’s Net worth:&nbsp;</strong>$500 Thousand</li><li><b>Famous for:&nbsp;</b>Marriage to Graham Wardle</li></ul><h2><strong>How Old is Allison Wardle?</strong></h2><p>According to several reports, Graham Wardle’s ex-wife Allison Wardle is currently 43 years old. Her exact date of birth is yet to be disclosed, but she was born in the year 1980. If these reports are true, it implies that Allison is over half a decade older than her former husband.</p><p>Reputable reports indicate that her ex-husband Graham Wardle was born in Mission, British Columbia, Canada, on the 6th of September 1986. This means he is 37 years old right now and about six years younger than Allison Wardle. Graham is one of six children born to his parents, and along with his siblings, he was raised near Vancouver, precisely in New Westminster.</p><p>He began his career with commercials and would later attend Capilano University to study in its Motion Picture and Production Program. These kinds of details about his former wife are yet to be uncovered. This is so because Allison Wardle was not famous until she began dating Graham and subsequently got married to him. All through the time they were together, and since they parted ways, Allison has always avoided the spotlight on her.</p><p>Because of that, things like who her parents her, the kind of childhood she had, who her siblings are, her educational accomplishments, and aspirations remain unknown. We can only confirm that she is a Canadian citizen of European ancestry. She was born in Canada, raised in Canada, and has lived in the country all her life.</p><h2><strong>Allison Wardle Became Graham Wardle’s Wife in 2015 and Divorced in 2018</strong></h2><p>Allison and her ex-husband Graham Wardle were very secretive about their relationship. Many people didn’t know the actor was dating anyone until when it emerged that he is married. Details like when they met, how they fell in love, and how long they dated are yet to be disclosed. We can only confirm that they were so much into each other that they decided to get married even though Allison is six years older.</p><p>From what we gathered, the former couple exchanged marital vows in April 2015. According to reports, they had a small wedding witnessed by close friends and immediate members of their respective families. After they officially became a couple, Allison and Graham continued to live a quiet life. Even though they were seen together in public several times, they carefully avoided gaining publicity.</p><p>For an onlooker, it seemed they were having a perfect marriage and wouldn’t allow noises from the media and the entertainment industry to pollute it. Given that, news of their divorce three years into the marriage came as a shock for many.</p><h3><strong>Meet Allison Wardle’s Ex-Husband, Graham Wardle</strong></h3><p>Information regarding what Allison Wardle does for a living might not be readily available to the public, but it is no secret that her former husband is an actor. As stated earlier, Graham began his career with commercials and is most known for portraying TY Borden in the CBC series Heartland.</p><p>He has been active in the entertainment industry since 1998, when he was seen as Young Aaron in the TV series, The Sentinel. Since then, he has portrayed dozens of characters in TV shows and movies. Some of his other prominent works as an actor include Supernatural (2005, 2013), In the Land of Women (2007), That One Night (2008), Grave Halloween (2013), and Hudson (2019).</p><p>More than being an actor, Allison Wardle’s ex-husband is a filmmaker. He was the casting director for Versus, a 2007 short film directed by Peter Harvey. As a producer, his works include Under Pressure: A Story of Microscopic Stakes (2008), The Vessel (2012), and Mi Madre, My Father (2018).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/12/Allison-Wardle-and-Graham-Wardle.jpg><h3><strong>The Former Couple Didn’t Have any Child Together</strong></h3><p>Graham Wardle and Allison Wardle’s marriage was short-lived. This is probably why they had no child together. The fact that their marriage didn’t produce any child is part of the reason why they had a quiet divorce. Like their wedding, many didn’t know the two had ended their marriage until the actor disclosed it.</p><p>In a Facebook Live session in 2020, the Heartland actor disclosed that he and Allison had been divorced since 2018. However, he failed to reveal why they ended their marriage. This has remained so to date; the reason Allison and Graham divorced is not known to the public.</p><h3><strong>Has </strong><strong>Allison Wardle</strong><strong>&nbsp;Re-married?</strong></h3><p>It is hard to tell if Allison Wardle has remarried. Since her marriage to Graham Wardle packed up, she has completely disappeared from the limelight. This is barely surprising as she has always wanted a quiet life, even when she was married to a famous actor.</p><h2><strong>What Does&nbsp;</strong><strong>Graham Wardle’s Ex-wife&nbsp;</strong><strong>Do for a Living?</strong></h2><p>From what we gathered, Allison Wardle makes a living as a photographer. Considering that her ex-husband is also a photographer, it is possible that the former couple met through their shared passion for photography. Details of Allison’s exploits as a photographer, like other details of her life, are not privy to the public.</p><p>However, we know that she likes traveling to take impressive pictures and capture beautiful moments and landscapes. Her former husband confirmed this in one of his many interviews. Speaking about the woman who would soon become his ex-wife, Graham Wardle described Allison as a talented woman with exceptional photographic eyes. And based on her works that he shared online, it is quite easy to agree with his assertion.</p><p>If Allison Wardle has other things she does for a living, she has successfully kept them discreet and away from the knowledge of the public. From all indications, she is her own woman and not someone to chase clout. Her marriage to the famous Canadian actor afforded her the opportunity to promote herself and what she does. But it was an opportunity she never utilized like most celebrity spouses are prone to do.</p><figure class=wp-block-table></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571KxmmqScYq6ju9StZJqknJ7AsLqMsJirnJyaeqi%2BwKGYpmWnlr%2BluMSsZJ6wXay2p7GO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fall-about-allison-wardle-graham-wardles-ex-wife.html&text=All%20About%20Allison%20Wardle%20-%20Graham%20Wardle%27s%20Ex-wife&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fall-about-allison-wardle-graham-wardles-ex-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fall-about-allison-wardle-graham-wardles-ex-wife.html&title=All%20About%20Allison%20Wardle%20-%20Graham%20Wardle%27s%20Ex-wife" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fall-about-allison-wardle-graham-wardles-ex-wife.html&title=All%20About%20Allison%20Wardle%20-%20Graham%20Wardle%27s%20Ex-wife" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fall-about-allison-wardle-graham-wardles-ex-wife.html&title=All%20About%20Allison%20Wardle%20-%20Graham%20Wardle%27s%20Ex-wife" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fall-about-allison-wardle-graham-wardles-ex-wife.html&description=All%20About%20Allison%20Wardle%20-%20Graham%20Wardle%27s%20Ex-wife" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./allyson-felix.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Allyson Felix Height, Weight, Family, Facts, Spouse, Education, Biography">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./alexis-rodericks-biography-who-really-is-billy-joels-4th-wife.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alexis Roderick's Biography - Who really is Billy Joel's 4th wife?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
