The pair married in a small ceremony a year later, and their son was born in 2013.</p><p>Bell and Wood separated the following year and have been engaged in a lengthy custody battle for their son since 2020.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Details of the Custody Battle</strong></h2><p>These allegations were made in the court battle with Jamie Bell over the parental custody of their son.</p><p>Wood also stated that Bell did not take the threats seriously and addressed the fact that she took Jack out of California to keep him safe.</p><p>Bell filed court papers to regain custody in which he stated that his former partner’s story <strong>“defies credibility,”</strong> adding:</p><p><strong>“I frankly do not understand what is happening. Either Evan’s claims that she is receiving ‘death threats’ are true and Jack is not safe in her care, or they are not true, and she is withholding our son from me for other reasons of her own invention.”</strong></p><p>The actor also revealed he had received no indication from Wood that she had installed extra security at her Los Angeles home.</p><p>As per the court papers, Bell stated he was aware that his ex-wife and son had moved to Nashville during the filming of a movie in New Mexico in fall 2021.</p><p>He claims that they were due to fly to California on December 18 so Jack could spend Christmas with his father; however, neither boarded the plane.</p><p>Bell texted Wood, asking if they had made it to Los Angeles safely, to which she replied they had.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“However, this was not true. Jack was never put on a plane,” </strong>he said. <strong>“Evan had me believe, for four days, that Jack was in California when in fact he was still in Tennessee.”</strong></p><p>Bell spent the next four days in extreme distress, adding that:</p><p><strong>“During those four days, I was not able to connect with Jack over FaceTime even though I tried every day. I tried contacting Evan’s mother because I had grown suspicious of Evan’s evasiveness and concerned about Jack’s whereabouts, but her mother, sadly, also would not respond.”</strong></p><p>Wood claims it is in their son’s best interests to remain in Nashville and believes Bell does not fully grasp the scope of the danger being in Los Angeles would expose the boy to.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Who Is Jamie Bell?</strong></h2><p>Jamie Bell was an English boy that grew to love dance when he accompanied his sister to ballet lessons.</p><p>In 1999, Bell felt confident enough to audition for the lead role in Billy Elliot, the film about an 11-year-old English boy who disappoints his father and brother by pursuing a future in ballet.</p><p>Bell was one of over 2,000 boys who auditioned for the lead role, and it seemed as though he was destined to play the role.</p><p>Having been a dancer since the age of 6, Bell grew up with dancers, his mother, sister, aunt, and grandmother all being inspiration dancers to the young boy.</p><p>The story also resonated with the young Bell, who was abandoned by his toolmaker father before he was even born.</p><p>Bell’s on-screen debut proved to be a massive success, and at the age of 14, he became the youngest winner for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role.</p><p>Other accolades include the London Film Critic’s Circle Award for British Newcomer of the Year, the British Independent Film Award for Best Newcomer, and the Evening Standard British Film Award for Most Promising Newcomer.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Bell’s Move To Adult Roles</strong></h2><p>After a stellar debut, it was only natural that Bell capitalized on his newfound fame, moving into more projects over the years.</p><p>For a young and relatively unknown performer, Bell’s rising star power gave way to working with some of the most prominent filmmakers in the <a href=#>business</a>.</p><p>Some of his more recognizable roles consist of Peter Jackson’s King Kong, Clint Eastwood’s Flags of Our Fathers, Bong Joon-Ho’s Snowpiercer, and Stephen Spielberg’s The Adventures of Tintin.</p><p>One of Bell’s biggest roles since Billy Elliot came with the portrayal of neo-n*zi Bryon Winder in Skin.</p><p>Bell committed to the role, spending three hours in the makeup chair to provide insight into how he should look and gorging himself on anything he could to gain enough weight to convince audiences that he was Winder.</p><p>Of the emotional toll of the role, Bell said:</p><p><strong>“This character is so far away from who I am, his detachment from compassion, from empathy, from kindness — from humanity,”</strong></p><p>Despite this, playing Winder provided him with valuable insight into his own ideas of intolerance, adding:</p><p><strong>“Essentially at certain points as we grow up, we’re all guilty … until we learn otherwise,” he said. “And then we adjust ourselves and have a course correction and go: That’s wrong. I need to change that behavior.”</strong></p><p>Bell followed this up with his portrayal of Elton John’s writing partner, Bernie Taupin, in the Taaron Egerton led-Rocketman, for which both actors received critical acclaim.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>About His Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Since his split from Wood in 2014, Bell fell in love with and married actress Kate Mara.</p><p>The two met on the set of Fantastic Four in 2015 and married two years later. In addition to Jack, Bell has a daughter he shares with Mara, born May 2019.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=#>Vogue Italia</a>, Bell opened up about his career, answering the question of why he did not follow in Billy Elliot’s footsteps and become a ballet dancer with:</p><p><strong>“I always lacked the right posture. What a pity!”</strong></p><p>In the same interview, he discussed the impact Skin had on his personal life during the shoot, saying:</p><p><strong>“Kate [Mara] couldn’t stand me after I finished shooting </strong><strong>Skin</strong><strong>. I was filled with anger and resentment. I had nightmares and I’d start screaming at night. She was scared and kept telling me to cool down.”</strong></p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC2wKagnmWSmrmtecGloKeco56xprCMnq2apl2nrqS0xKVksKefmXw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjamie-bell-blindsided-evan-rachel-wood.html&text=Why%20Jamie%20Bell%20Will%20Not%20Back%20Down%20During%20The%20Ongoing%20Custody%20Battle%20For%20His%20Son&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjamie-bell-blindsided-evan-rachel-wood.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjamie-bell-blindsided-evan-rachel-wood.html&title=Why%20Jamie%20Bell%20Will%20Not%20Back%20Down%20During%20The%20Ongoing%20Custody%20Battle%20For%20His%20Son" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjamie-bell-blindsided-evan-rachel-wood.html&title=Why%20Jamie%20Bell%20Will%20Not%20Back%20Down%20During%20The%20Ongoing%20Custody%20Battle%20For%20His%20Son" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjamie-bell-blindsided-evan-rachel-wood.html&title=Why%20Jamie%20Bell%20Will%20Not%20Back%20Down%20During%20The%20Ongoing%20Custody%20Battle%20For%20His%20Son" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjamie-bell-blindsided-evan-rachel-wood.html&description=Why%20Jamie%20Bell%20Will%20Not%20Back%20Down%20During%20The%20Ongoing%20Custody%20Battle%20For%20His%20Son" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./wivn-tv-4-melanie-orlins-bio-age-husband-family-salary.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="WIVN-TV 4 Melanie Orlins Bio, Age, Husband, Family, Salary">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./whoopi-goldbergs-relationships-who-are-her-ex-husbands.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Whoopi Goldberg's Relationships: Who Are Her Ex-Husbands?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
