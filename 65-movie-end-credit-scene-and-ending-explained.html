The newest sci-fu thriller 65 is now available in theatres.</p><p>Written and directed by Scott Beck and Bryan Woods, the movie stars Adam Driver, Ariana Greenblatt, and Chloe Coleman.</p><p>It is a co-production between Bron Creative, Columbia Pictures, Beck/Woods, and Raimi Productions.</p><p>The film was released on March 10, 2023, in the United States by Sony Pictures. It was released alongside Scream VI and Champions in the US and Canada.</p><p>In the film, a spaceship pilot crashes on an unknown planet, which is Earth during the Cretaceous period. Now, the surviving crew must face the dangerous prehistoric environment.</p><p>Principal photography of the film began on December 7, 2020. Filming also took place in the Kisatchie National Forest in Vernon Parish. The schedule wrapped up on February 21, 2021.</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content" role=button><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></a></span><ul class="ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 eztoc-toggle-hide-by-default"><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1" href=# title="65 Movie Has An End Credit Scene">65 Movie Has An End Credit Scene</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2" href=# title="65 Movie Ending Explained">65 Movie Ending Explained</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-3" href=# title="What Is The 65 Movie About?">What Is The 65 Movie About?</a></li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=65-movie-has-an-end-credit-scene></span>65 Movie Has An End Credit Scene<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>65 movie has an end credit scene that shows an animated look at how the Earth changed over time. There is no post-credit scene in the movie.</p><p>Many titles these days, particularly ones that are part of a franchise, will embrace an extra clip at the end to hint at future installments or to give viewers some extra content.</p><p>And Yes, there is a scene during the credits of the newest sci-fi 65. So, if you wish to check it out, stick around to the end. However, there’s nothing at the end of the credits, so feel free to depart once the scene ends.</p><figure></figure><p>The credit scene shows an animated look at how the Earth changed over time at the place where the asteroid impacted the planet million years ago. The scene doesn’t mark an addition to the plot, so don’t fear if you miss it!</p><p>The audience will further see that the landscape has produced some skyscrapers. It’s unlikely that this is planet Earth, as it was sixty-five million years ago. It’s probably Mills and Koa’s home planet.</p><p>It signals that the duo made it to their destination safe and sound.</p><figure></figure><p>Even though there are dinosaurs, lead actor Driver&nbsp;clarified&nbsp;that 65 is not a time travel movie. There is no actual time travel in this action-packed science-fiction movie.</p><p>Trailers for the movie may make it seem that the movie involves a time travel plot, but the actor said that this is not so and that his character, Mills, does not actually go back in time.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=65-movie-ending-explained></span>65 Movie Ending Explained<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>65 movie ending reveals that Mills finally makes it to the pod in time and makes it out of the planet.</p><p>In the movie, the spaceship that Mills is piloting crash land the day before the asteroid that created the extinction level is to arrive.</p><p>The ship, transporting 35 passengers, who spoke different languages, was hit by an asteroid. Besides Mills, a little girl named Koa (Greenblatt) was the only survivor of the crash.</p><p>And as the asteroid was about to hit the place, they only had like 12 hours to get off the planet, and yes, they did at the last.</p><p>Mills had to undergo a two-year space mission to get medical care for his daughter, Chloe Coleman, who was suffering from some terminal disease. Despite his efforts, she passed away while he was away.</p><figure></figure><p>As the translator on the ship is wrecked in the crash, Mill and Koa cannot communicate well. The little girls pick up on a couple of words like family, move, run, and home, especially in intense moments.</p><p>The duo aren’t being hunted by aliens, but are being hunted by dangerous dinosaurs. These creatures can kill them in an instant so the language barrier caused major issues.</p><p>As a result, Mills spends most of the film attempting to keep the little girl safe from dinosaurs.</p><p>In one of the ending scenes, when the duo gets to the other half of the ship, the little girl finds the cryo pod. The device is all broken near the ruins of the transport ship.</p><figure></figure><p>It possibly had one of her parents inside, because after she finds it, she looks through the glass, and freaks out at the ruined pod. It’s when Koa truly realizes that her family is gone, and she refuses to get into the escape pod.</p><p>Thankfully Mills made it to the pod in time, making their way out of the planet before the asteroid arrives.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-65-movie-about></span>What Is The 65 Movie About?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>65 movie is about two spaceship crash survivors, Mills and Koa. They are the only survivors of the crash, and now they have to fight dinosaurs and try to beat a ticking clock.</p><p>Set 65 million years ago, Mills is the pilot of the transport ship that is carrying 35 passengers to another planet that will take him two years. Unfortunately, the ship is hit by an asteroid, knocking it into a mysterious planet.</p><p>The crash nearly kills everyone on board. It turns out that the unknown planet is Earth in its Cretaceous period and is filled with dinosaurs. One passenger managed to survive -a little girl named Koa.</p><figure></figure><p>Koas doesn’t speak and understand English, so the duo has difficulty communicating with each other. Mills had trouble making her understand that they need to escape by using the one escape pod left.</p><p>The translating device is broken in the crash. So, the pilot spends most of the movie time trying to keep the girl safe from dinosaurs.</p><p>Most of the running time of the movie includes scenes in which the two survivors run into one or more screaming dinosaurs before they shoot or blast them into oblivion.</p><p>Throughout the movie, Mills only speaks a few words, with the little girl repeating them quizzically.</p><figure></figure><p>Nonetheless, their relationship does generate some warmth, with Koa acting as a substitute daughter, which rouses Driver’s protective paternal instincts.</p><p>The pacing itself is pretty satisfying, all things considered. The use of Mills’ daughter Nevine (Coleman) to break the story at times and help move viewers forward is appreciable. Nevine has some really great moments.</p><p>There is that parallel connection between her to Koa that viewers must consider to understand the bond between Mills and Koa.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaG5lYrqwwsieZJ6mlGKws7HDoqtmq5Oau6Z5wKebZp2embavs4yer6mkkZ67prCO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f65-movie-end-credit-scene-and-ending-explained.html&text=65%20Movie%20End%20Credit%20Scene%20and%20Ending%20Explained&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f65-movie-end-credit-scene-and-ending-explained.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f65-movie-end-credit-scene-and-ending-explained.html&title=65%20Movie%20End%20Credit%20Scene%20and%20Ending%20Explained" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f65-movie-end-credit-scene-and-ending-explained.html&title=65%20Movie%20End%20Credit%20Scene%20and%20Ending%20Explained" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f65-movie-end-credit-scene-and-ending-explained.html&title=65%20Movie%20End%20Credit%20Scene%20and%20Ending%20Explained" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f65-movie-end-credit-scene-and-ending-explained.html&description=65%20Movie%20End%20Credit%20Scene%20and%20Ending%20Explained" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./adolis-garcia-wiki-whats-his-ethnicity-explore-his-origin-and-personal-life-694565-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Adolis Garcia Wiki | Whats His Ethnicity | Explore His Origin And Personal Life">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./christmas-all-over-the-world-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="                    Tim McGraw                                          Christmas All Over The">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
