He killed 23 people, injured 23 others, and targeted Hispanic shoppers. Crusius was arrested, pleaded guilty to hate crime charges, and received 90 consecutive life sentences. The shooting is one of the deadliest in recent US history and was condemned as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime.</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wikibiography.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Untitled-design-3-32-300x169.png alt="Patrick Crusius" width=483 height=272 sizes="(max-width: 483px) 100vw, 483px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Patrick_Crusius_Early_Life_and_Age></span>Patrick Crusius Early Life and Age:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Patrick Crusius, the shooter at the Walmart in El Paso, Texas, was born in 1998 to White Caucasian parents in Allen, Texas. He grew up in Plano City, Texas, with an elder brother and a twin sister. Crusius attended Beverly Elementary School in Plano, where he had a school friend named Daniel Heo. However, as he got older, Crusius became increasingly radicalized, leading to his involvement in the tragic shooting at Walmart. The attack targeted Hispanic shoppers, resulting in multiple deaths and injuries. Crusius was arrested, pleaded guilty to hate crime charges, and received 90 consecutive life sentences.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Patricks_Educational_Background></span>Patrick’s Educational Background:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Patrick Crusius began his educational journey at Beverly Elementary School in Plano, where he formed a friendship with Daniel Heo, engaging in sports activities such as school and basketball during their free time. Later on, Crusius continued his education at Liberty High School. However, he ultimately completed his graduation from Plano Senior High School.</p><p>Following his high school education, Crusius pursued his Bachelor’s degree at Collin College in McKinney, Texas. Although his time at college was cut short as he dropped out after two years, his enrollment at Collin College marked his academic pursuit beyond high school.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Patrick_Crusius_Walmart_Shooter_Convicted></span>Patrick Crusius: Walmart Shooter Convicted<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>On the afternoon of August 3, 2019, a tragic event unfolded at a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas, United States, when an individual or group opened fire. Patrick Wood Crusius, at the age of 21, was identified as the perpetrator of this heinous act of terrorism, which resulted in the loss of over 20 lives. Following the incident, Crusius was apprehended and subsequently charged with first-degree capital murder.</p><p>The shooting took place on the east side of El Paso, specifically at a Walmart adjacent to the Cielo Vista Mall. In a recent development, Crusius has been sentenced to ninety consecutive life sentences for his crimes. It is important to note, however, that he may still face further consequences, potentially including the possibility of the death penalty. The incident stands as a tragic reminder of the devastating impact of acts of violence within our communities.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wikibiography.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Untitled-design-4-19-300x169.png alt="Walmart Shooter Convicted" width=515 height=290 sizes="(max-width: 515px) 100vw, 515px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Patrick_Crusius_Net_worth></span>Patrick Crusius Net worth:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>As of 2023, Patrick Crusius has an estimated net worth of $1 million. It is important to note that this information is speculative and may not be entirely accurate. The net worth figure could have been derived from various sources, such as his family’s assets, any earnings he had prior to the shooting, or potential legal settlements. However, due to the severity of his crimes and subsequent legal proceedings, it is unlikely that he has access to his assets or the ability to accumulate wealth while serving his sentence.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Information_Table></span>Information Table:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><table><tbody><tr><td>Name</td><td>Patrick Crusius</td></tr><tr><td>Nickname</td><td>Patrick</td></tr><tr><td>Gender</td><td>Male</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>An employee in a private company</td></tr><tr><td>Height (approx.)</td><td>&nbsp;<p>in feet inches- 5ft 8inch</p></td></tr><tr><td>Weight (approx.)</td><td>in kilograms<strong>– 68 kg</strong><p>in pounds<strong>– 149 lb</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td>Figure Measurements (approx.)</td><td>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Colour</td><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Hair Colour</td><td>Dark Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Date of Birth</td><td>27 July, 1998</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td>25 Years Old</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>Allen, Texas, America</td></tr><tr><td>Zodiac sign/Sun sign</td><td>Taurus</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Hometown</td><td>Allen, Texas, America</td></tr><tr><td>School</td><td>Plano Senior High School</td></tr><tr><td>College/University</td><td>Collin College in McKinney, Texas.</td></tr><tr><td>Educational Qualification</td><td>Graduate</td></tr><tr><td>Religion</td><td>Christianity</td></tr><tr><td>Ethnicity</td><td>White Caucasian</td></tr><tr><td>Caste</td><td>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td>Address</td><td>Dallas, Fort Worth, Texas</td></tr><tr><td>Hobbies/Interests</td><td>Traveling</td></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>Unmarried</td></tr><tr><td>ExAffairs/Boyfriends/Girlfriends</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Sexuality</td><td>Not known</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td><strong>Father: Not Known</strong><p><strong>Mother: Not known<br></strong></p></td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Sister – twin sister<p>Brother- one elder brother</p></td></tr><tr><td>Husband/Wife/Spouse</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$1 Million</td></tr></tbody></table><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Some_Lesser_facts_about_Patrick></span>Some Lesser facts about Patrick:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><ul><li>Patrick Crusius was responsible for the shooting at a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas on August 3, 2019.</li><li>He was charged with first-degree capital murder and received a sentence of 90 consecutive life sentence</li><li>Crusius attended Plano Senior High School during his high school years.</li><li>He later enrolled at Collin College in McKinney, Texas to pursue his Bachelor’s degree.</li><li>Crusius was born in 1998 in Allen, Texas, and was raised in Plano City.</li><li>The shooting targeted Hispanic shoppers and resulted in the deaths of over 20 people.</li><li>Crusius has been described as a white supremacist and was involved in online radicalization prior to the shooting.</li><li>His net worth, as of 2023, is estimated to be around $1 million, although this figure may be speculative.</li><li>The shooting at the Walmart in El Paso is considered an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime.</li><li>Crusius’ actions have had a profound impact on the victims, their families, and the community, serving as a reminder of the dangers of radicalization and the need for unity and understanding.</li></ul><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=FAQs_about_Patrick></span>FAQs about Patrick :<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>1.
