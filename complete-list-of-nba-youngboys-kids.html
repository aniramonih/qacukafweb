They are Kayden, Kacey, Taylin, Armani, Kodi Capri, Kamiri, Kentrell Jr, Nora, and Klemenza Tru.</strong></p><p>NBA Youngboy is well known for his consistency in dropping songs. As of 2022, he has released 26 studio albums, mixtapes, and EPs since he started his singing career in 2015. What’s more, the rapper has been making headlines over the frequency through which he welcomes children with different women, even though he is not married to any of them yet.</p><h2><strong>Meet NBA YoungBoy’s Children</strong></h2><p>YoungBoy is notorious for going through women with unqualified ease. Born Kentrell DeSean Gaulden, NBA YoungBoy, also known as YoungBoy Never Broke Again or simply YoungBoy rose to prominence following the release of his hit song, Outside Today, and has since been making headlines for different reasons.</p><p>The rapper is no stranger to the limelight, starting from his thriving music career to his criminal records and then his relationship with several women. But, in this post, we are focusing only on the number of children he has fathered with different women.</p><h3><strong>Kayden Gaulden is YoungBoy’s First Child</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> 4th July 2016</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 7 years old</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Male</li><li><strong>Mother:</strong> Nisha Keller</li></ul><p>Kayden Gaulden was born on 4th July 2016, in Los Angeles, USA. He is the first child of his father, NBA YoungBoy, and his mother, Nisha Keller, a magazine model. He has one biological sibling named Armani Gaulden and several other siblings whom his father had with different women</p><p>Although nothing much is known about his personal life as he is still very young, Kayden is often seen on stage with his famous father during his shows. He was featured alongside his half-brother Kacey in YoungBoy’s music video for “Kacey Talk.” He also regularly features on his father’s Instagram account.</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/12/kayy.png alt=kayden width=698 height=441 sizes="(max-width: 698px) 100vw, 698px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Kayden is being raised in the spotlight by both his father and mother, respectively. When his father is away, he stays with his mother. At age 6, Kayden receives his elementary education at a prestigious school in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. We are still looking forward to seeing what the future holds for the celebrity kid as he grows, even though we are sure he is set for a bright future.</p><h3><strong>Taylin</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> 19th March 2017</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 6 years old</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Male</li><li><strong>Mother:</strong> Nia</li></ul><p>Taylin is one of YoungBoy’s nine children born to him by his ex Nia. Nia reportedly got pregnant with Taylin after a one-night stand with YoungBoy. They never had a friendship or relationship. Following Taylin’s birth, the rapper had to conduct a paternity test to confirm that he is the biological father.</p><h3><strong>Kamiri</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> 6th July 2017</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 6 years old</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Male</li><li><strong>Mother:</strong> Starr Dejanee</li></ul><p>Kamiri was born in July 2017 and is 6 years old at the moment. His mother is Starr Dejanee, one of YoungBoy’s ex-girlfriends.</p><h3><strong>Kacey</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> 13th February 2019</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 4 years old</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Male</li><li><strong>Mother:</strong> Jania Bania</li></ul><p>Kacey’s birth made YoungBoy a father for the fourth time. He was born in February 2019 to the rapper and his ex-girlfriend Jania Bania, a social media influencer and model. Jania is known for posting fashion and lifestyle photos on her Instagram page, and her son Kacey is also frequently pictured with her.</p><h3><strong>Armani Gaulden</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> 2020</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 3 years old</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Female</li><li><strong>Mother:</strong> Nisha Kella</li></ul><p>Armani was born in 2020 and is now 3 years old. She is Kayden’s biological younger sister, born by the same mother, Nisha.</p><h3><strong>Kodi Capri</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> 26th November 2020</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 3 years old</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Female</li><li><strong>Mother:</strong> Drea Symone</li></ul><p>YoungBoy and his ex, Drea Symone, welcomed their daughter Kodi Capri on 26th November 2020. Kodi is 3 years old, and Drea often shares photos of her on Instagram.</p><h3><strong>Kentrell Jr.</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> 9th January 2021</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 2 years old</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Male</li><li><strong>Mother:</strong> Iyanna Mayweather</li></ul><p>Kentrell Jr is one of YoungBoy’s children, born on the 9th of January 2021. YoungBoy had him with his ex-girlfriend Iyanna Mayweather whom he reportedly got engaged to before they called it quits. Iyanna is a social media personality best known as the daughter of <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Floyd Mayweather</a>, the world-famous American professional boxer.</p><h3><strong>Alice Nora</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> 2021</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 2 years old</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Female</li><li><strong>Mother:</strong> Jazlyn Mychelle</li></ul><p>NBA YoungBoy and his fiance Jazlyne welcomed their first child, a daughter named Nora, in 2021. She is just 2 years old and already has a younger brother.</p><h3><strong>Klemenza Tru</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> September 2022</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 1 years old</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Male</li><li><strong>Mother:</strong> Jazlyn Mychelle</li></ul><p>On 4th September 2022, Young Boy took to social media to announce that he and his fiancee Jazlyn Mychelle were expecting their second child together. The rapper had posted a photo of baby bum with Jazlyn wearing what seems to be an engagement ring. He later confirmed that he and Jazyline had gotten engaged.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/12/kayy.png><p>On the 28th of September, both YoungBoy and Jazlyn announced the arrival of the baby, a son who they named Klemenza Tru. The couple didn’t state exactly which date the baby was born, but it was on the 28th of September that both of them posted the same photo of him feeding the newborn.</p><h3><strong>Kamron</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> July 2016</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 7 years old</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Male</li><li><strong>Mother:</strong> Starr Dejanee</li></ul><p>Kamron is not YoungBoy’s biological child but is Kamiri’s younger brother, born by the same mother, Starr. YoungBoy named Kamron as his child in a 2017 profile for The Fader, but a DNA test later confirmed he is not his biological son.</p><p>Regardless, YoungBoy has since been raising Kamron as his own child. Hence, some sources are not careful to differentiate him from his biological children. Consequently, most of the sources report that he has ten children.</p><h2><strong>How Old Was YoungBoy When He Had His First Child?</strong></h2><p>NBA YoungBoy was only 17 years old at the time he had his first child, Kayden, which was in 2016. The rapper was born on 20th October 1999 and is now 24 years old. For someone with such a large family and still counting, one would believe that the rapper has enough cash to support and keep them all afloat, regardless of his age.</p><p>While congratulating him on the arrival of his 9th child, a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Twitter</a> user foretold that by the year 2024, the world will be filled with descendants of NBA YoungBoy, Future, and Nick Cannon. The prediction actually does not seem too farfetched. Replying to the tweet, another user said “World war 3 will just be each descendants fighting each other”.</p><p>All of NBA YoungBoy’s kids are still very much young, and as such, there is not much information about them yet as the career or professional parts they would take on are yet to be known.</p><p>Meanwhile, from what is obvious, the Outside Today crooner has a good relationship with all his children, even though we do not have information regarding if they are all living with him or with their individual mothers. From what we can see in the photos, the rapper makes out quality time to spend with all of them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571KxmnKedpbmmwMRmo6KrpGK8p3nNm5hmsZ%2Bqu6iuzrKqZqOZmcBw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcomplete-list-of-nba-youngboys-kids.html&text=Complete%20List%20of%20NBA%20Youngboys%20Kids&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcomplete-list-of-nba-youngboys-kids.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcomplete-list-of-nba-youngboys-kids.html&title=Complete%20List%20of%20NBA%20Youngboys%20Kids" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcomplete-list-of-nba-youngboys-kids.html&title=Complete%20List%20of%20NBA%20Youngboys%20Kids" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcomplete-list-of-nba-youngboys-kids.html&title=Complete%20List%20of%20NBA%20Youngboys%20Kids" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcomplete-list-of-nba-youngboys-kids.html&description=Complete%20List%20of%20NBA%20Youngboys%20Kids" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./dan-gable-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dan Gable Net Worth | Wife">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./clayton-kershaw-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Clayton Kershaw Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
