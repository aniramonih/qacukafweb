When the time came to head home, she jumped into a friend's car, not knowing the decision would change her life forever.</p><p class=dh>On February 21, 2010, High school senior Chelsie Hill was at a party with a group of her peers. She had a good night, dancing and enjoying herself. After a while, she decided to head home but hadn't arranged a ride beforehand, so she ran up to the first car she saw. Luckily, it was owned by a friend.</p><p class=dh>She fully expected the driver to be responsible enough not to drink before driving and didn't question the fact that she had seen him earlier with a cup in hand. She didn't think he'd endanger the lives of all his passengers by getting behind the wheel if he wasn't entirely sober. So, she and a few other people hopped in.</p><p class=dh>Hill didn't notice any slurry speech or uncoordinated movement from their driver, so she relaxed and enjoyed the <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CJ_pBz7puJx/>ride</a>. On the way, they passed her house, and the guy behind the wheel offered to drop her off. Hill declined, saying he could let her out when they came back, and settled in for the rest of the short trip.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>In February 2020, the love of her life got down on one knee in front of her and asked for her hand in marriage.</strong></p><p class=dh>The ride was entertaining, with seniors singing along to blaring music and having a last bit of fun before they inevitably ended up back at home. They were cruising along when the car suddenly swerved alarmingly. A curbstone hit the wheel, and the vehicle careened off the road, colliding with a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CLml2feJsAU/>tree</a> head-on.</p><p class=dh>Hill was unconscious, like many of those with her in the car, and she retains little memory of what precisely happened in the moments after the crash. However, she does recall the panic, the fear, and the uncertainty she felt as the reality of the situation dawned on her.</p><p class=dh>The swooping noise of helicopter blades cut through her unconscious thoughts, and Hill was rushed to a local hospital, where she underwent intensive spinal surgery. The operation lasted an astounding seven and a half hours, and Hill had no feeling in her legs when she came to.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Moving on with Her Life</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>After the accident, Hill's whole life changed. She lives as a T10 paraplegic, but she has no intention of letting her disability define her. Over the next ten years, Chelsie rebuilt her life, occasionally advocating for others with disabilities. In February 2020, the love of her life got down on one knee in front of her and asked for her hand in marriage.</p><p class=dh>To celebrate the anniversary of their engagement, Hill posted a video montage of her with her soon-to-be husband, Jay Bloomfield, showing all the wonderful memories they had made so far. In the caption, Hill <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CLfAMGQJWnE/>gushed</a>, "You have the biggest heart and love unconditionally."</p><p class=dh>Hill and Bloomfield made things official on September 29, 2021, a year after their engagement. The two had a beautiful day planned, with all of their friends and family present. But Hill had one more card up her sleeve that even Bloomfield didn't know about.</p><p class=dh>With the help of close confidantes, Hill organized a big surprise for her husband. She bought a pair of leg braces and a walker, anticipating her big moment. When the music started, and with her groom waiting at the altar, the doors opened, and Hill came walking out, smiling as she made her way down the aisle.</p><p class=dh>Hill had asked Bloomfield to stand with his back facing the door, and when he turned around, he couldn't believe his eyes. Hill shared that he was completely taken by surprise to see his bride walking down the aisle toward him. She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/human-interest/groom-jaw-drops-when-bride-who-uses-wheelchair-walks-down-aisle-at-wedding/>recalled</a>:</p><p class=dh>"As soon as I saw Jay, his jaw dropped. He was just in shock that I was walking because he had no idea."</p><p class=dh>With her father guiding her toward her husband and Bloomfield looking on in astonishment, Hill smiled all the way. A custom wedding dress with a removable skirt let Hill quickly get back into her wheelchair at the altar, where the gleeful couple exchanged vows. However, she emphasized there's nothing wrong with being in a wheelchair.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Hill and Bloomfield's Life Now</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Besides marrying the man of her dreams, Hill also had the chance to raise a little one of her own. Despite her disability, Hill and Bloomfield have started their family and are excited about what the future holds. In 2021, Hill made a post on Instagram looking back at her life and showing how thankful she is for how far she has come. She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/Co78FrHv69m/>wrote</a>:</p><p class=dh>"I was holding my daughter this morning around 1:30am (which was the time the car accident happened) and I started crying happy tears and felt so thankful to be alive (sic)."</p><p class=dh>She continued, saying how glad she was to have found Bloomfield and what a blessing their child has been. Although the anniversary of her accident was always an emotional time for her, she has learned to look at life from a different point of view, and now she treasures the things that gave her life meaning.</p><p class=dh>On March 21, 2023, Hill also shared an image of her and her little one smiling broadly at the camera. She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CqDv1Zmplft/>captioned</a> the snapshot, "Being a mom is the best reason you'll ever have to take care of you 💖." The photo showed Hill in her wheelchair, holding her daughter on her lap.</p><p class=dh>Although Hill is a devoted mother and wife, she also makes time for herself and her ambitions. Before her accident, Hill was an avid dancer and planned to make a living as a performer. Doctors thought she would never dance again, but when her dad found her an able-bodied wheelchair, she found her way back to her passion.</p><p class=dh>Now, Hill has started her own dance company for people in wheelchairs, helping individuals of all ages express themselves through movement. Hill is part of the Rollettes, and through their love of dance, they inspire others with disabilities. She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CN2q0tUp_hL/>wrote</a>: "I want to show the world that 'dance is dance Whether you're walking or rolling.' (sic)."</p><p class=dh>Want more like this? <a class="me a" href=#>Click here</a> to read about a man who marries a disabled woman and was accused of being with her for money.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jm1nbHFla3qxrdGao7KylZl6o77InZxmpZGZsm6z0aimpmWTp8Zuw8eepWarmJp7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f403956-paralyzed-bride-made-groom-cry-when-she-html.html&text=Paralyzed%20Bride%20Made%20Groom%20Cry%20When%20She%20Stood%20up%20from%20Wheelchair%20-%20She%20Made%20Him%20a%20Happy%20Dad%203%20Years%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f403956-paralyzed-bride-made-groom-cry-when-she-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f403956-paralyzed-bride-made-groom-cry-when-she-html.html&title=Paralyzed%20Bride%20Made%20Groom%20Cry%20When%20She%20Stood%20up%20from%20Wheelchair%20-%20She%20Made%20Him%20a%20Happy%20Dad%203%20Years%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f403956-paralyzed-bride-made-groom-cry-when-she-html.html&title=Paralyzed%20Bride%20Made%20Groom%20Cry%20When%20She%20Stood%20up%20from%20Wheelchair%20-%20She%20Made%20Him%20a%20Happy%20Dad%203%20Years%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f403956-paralyzed-bride-made-groom-cry-when-she-html.html&title=Paralyzed%20Bride%20Made%20Groom%20Cry%20When%20She%20Stood%20up%20from%20Wheelchair%20-%20She%20Made%20Him%20a%20Happy%20Dad%203%20Years%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f403956-paralyzed-bride-made-groom-cry-when-she-html.html&description=Paralyzed%20Bride%20Made%20Groom%20Cry%20When%20She%20Stood%20up%20from%20Wheelchair%20-%20She%20Made%20Him%20a%20Happy%20Dad%203%20Years%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./robert-ochoa.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Robert Ochoa- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Ethnicity">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./paget-brewster.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Paget Brewster Net Worth, Age, Height, Husband, Family, Wiki 2024">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
