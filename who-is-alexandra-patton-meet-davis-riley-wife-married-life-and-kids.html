The college sweethearts married in late 2022 after five years of courtship.</strong></p><p>Davis has been fortunate to have such a supportive companion over the years, and it appears that his golf career fortune has shined even brighter since marriage. Riley, who turned pro in 2019, earned his first PGA Tour title with Nick Hardy a few months after their wedding, the 2023 Zurich Classic of New Orleans.</p><p>Davis Riley, born December 17, 1996, is a professional golfer from the United States who has earned $5.989 million in his career as of this writing. He has yet to compete in the Masters Tournament, but he has competed in three other major championships: the US Open, the PGA Championship, and the Open Championship.</p><p>Riley finished 31st in the 2022 US Open, having previously missed the cut in 2015 and 2020. He also secured the 13th slot in the PGA Championship in 2022. He formerly competed on the Korn Ferry Tour, where he won two championships: the 2020 Panama Championship and the 2020 TPC San Antonio Championship.</p><h2><span id=Davis_Riley_and_Alexandra_Pattons_Marriage>Davis Riley and Alexandra Patton’s Marriage</span></h2><p>Davis Riley and his girlfriend-turned-wife Alexandra married on December 17, 2022, after a 10-month engagement. The ceremony was held at Royal Lane Baptist Church in Dallas, Texas, and the reception was held in Arlington Hall at Turtle Creek. The PGA Tour golfer wore a traditional black tuxedo, but his wife opted for a backless white gown with a bow.</p><p>The dress code for guys was a black tie with a formal dress, while the dress code for ladies was floor-length gowns or formal pantsuits, according to The Knot wedding register information. The wedding date for Davis and Alexandra, on the other hand, falls on the golfer’s 26th birthday.</p><h2><span id=Davis_and_Alexandra_Met_in_College_Details_on_Their_Engagement_and_Relationship>Davis and Alexandra Met in College: Details on Their Engagement and Relationship</span></h2><p>Riley and his wife Patton met and began dating while undergraduates at the University of Alabama. Though they have not revealed how their relationship began, Davis’ fame as a college golfer probably sparked their connection. The two had been dating since September 30, 2017, when they were juniors, according to reports.</p><p>On the fourth anniversary of their relationship, Davis Riley posted an Instagram photo with his girlfriend (now wife), Alexandra. On Valentine’s Day 2022, after four and a half years of dating, the golfer got down on one knee and proposed to Patton. He announced his engagement on Instagram. Davis is used to the routine: an engagement proposal on Valentine’s Day, followed by a wedding on his birthday!</p><h2><span id=Do_They_Have_Children_Together>Do They Have Children Together?</span></h2><p>No, the couple hasn’t had any children yet. They do appear to be dog parents.</p><h2><span id=Alexandra_Patton_Rileys_Profession>Alexandra Patton Riley’s Profession</span></h2><p>Alexandra Patton is a senior experienced Hire Recruiting Coordinator at Deloitte (December 2021-now). She formerly worked at Phi Mu Alpha Zeta, which she joined right after graduating. In 2019, she graduated from the University of Alabama with a bachelor’s degree in hotel management and meeting and event planning.</p><h2><span id=Discover_Alexandra_Pattons_Family>Discover Alexandra Patton’s Family</span></h2><p>Alexandra Patton was born in Alabama on April 19, 1997, to parents Mark Patton and Theresa Hebert Patton. For many decades, her parents had celebrated their anniversary on December 5th. Her mother is a stay-at-home mom, as previously stated, while her father’s work is unclear.</p><p>Davis Riley’s wife, Alexandra Patton, is the oldest child of her parents. Her younger brother, Harrison Patton, was born on September 13, 2000. Harrison studied accounting at her alma mater, the University of Alabama (2019-2023). Alexandra frequently updates her Facebook page with images of her parents and brother. Her mother and brother are on Facebook as well, but her father does not.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: M.
