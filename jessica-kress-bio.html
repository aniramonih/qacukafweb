She was born to a proud father, Tom Murphy<span data-preserver-spaces=true>, while her mother’s name is unknown.</span></p><p>Sadly, Jessica has not spilled much when it comes to her personal life that much. Anything regarding her parent’s whereabouts and childhood is kept a secret.</p><p>Same like that, the information on her siblings is also close to nothing.</p><p>As for her education, Jessica attended Bayview Middle School and also St. Joseph’s Academy. After her high school, she enrolled at the University of Wisconsin, Green Bay.</p><h2>Jessica Kress | Age, Body Measurements & Horoscope</h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Having been born on February 9, 1972</span>,<span data-preserver-spaces=true> Kress is 51&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>years</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true> at the moment. Also, her star sign happens to be Aquarius.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Sadly, the details regarding Jessica’s age and body measurements are unknown at the moment.</p><p>However, stay tuned as we will update this piece of information as soon as it is made available to the public.</p><p>Nevertheless, her husband, Mike, is currently <span data-preserver-spaces=true>60</span> years old, as&nbsp;he was born on November 10, 1963, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Hence, McCarthy’s birth sign is Scorpio.</p><p>Moving onto Kress’s husband’s body measurements, he stands at 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m) tall and weighs around 100 kg (220 lb.).</p><p>Back in the day, Mike used his big body frame to bully his high school teammates on the football ground.</p><p><strong>You Can Learn About <a href=# rel=noopener>LeBron James’ Wife, Savannah Brinson>>&nbsp;</a></strong></p><h2>Jessica Kress | Career</h2><p>Regarding her career, Jessica works as an elementary school teacher near Lambey Field, the home of the Green Bay Packers.</p><p>Regrettably, that is all we could find on the internet. On the contrary, most of us know what her husband, Mike McCarthy, does.</p><p>In fact, if you go to the Green Bay area in Wisconsin and ask about Mike, they will sing folklore to you. The reason being, McCarthy led them to the Super Bowl victory in the 2010 season after a long wait.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Mike-McCarthy-head-coach-Of-The-Dallas-Cowboys.webp><p>However, Mike was not always the man calling the shots. In fact, he started as a defensive graduate assistant and then the defensive coordinator at Fort Hays State University by Duane Dirk in Kansas City.</p><p>McCarthy also worked as an offensive quality control assistant and quarterbacks coach for the Packers.</p><p>After that, he slowly climbed through the ranks with New Orleans Saints and San Francisco 49ers before landing his first head coach role with the Packers in 2006.</p><p>Subsequently, McCarthy stayed with the franchise for 12 years before getting relieved FROM his job in 2018.</p><p>However, after a two-year hiatus, Mike returned as the head coach of the most expensive sports team in the whole world, the Dallas Cowboys.</p><p>McCarthy has managed 45 games for the Cowboys with 27 wins and 18 losses.</p><h2>Jessica Kress | Net Worth & Salary</h2><p>Talking about Jessica’s net worth, it is unknown at the moment. However, because she works as a teacher at an elementary school, we believe that she earns a yearly salary of <strong>$58,000</strong>.</p><p>The reason being, it is the median salary of elementary school teachers. But, on the other hand, there is limitless data on her husband and Super Bowl XLV winning coach, Mike McCarthy.&nbsp;</p><p>Because Mike is one of the NFL’s best coaches, he gets paid accordingly.</p><p>To be precise, McCarthy will take home $4 million per year after signing with the Dallas Cowboys in 2020 after signing a 5-year contract.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, Mike has a net worth of <strong>$9 million,</strong> which is quite right considering he has been working as a head coach for 14 years.</p><p><strong>Don’t Forget To Check Out<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Casey Sadler Bio: 2020, Wife, Trade, Career, Contract, Net Worth Wiki>></a></strong></p><h2>Jessica Kress | Marriage & Kids</h2><p>Mike and Jessica have been married since 2008. Unlike most rich celebrities, the couple decided to get married in an intimate wedding to which only seven people were invited.</p><p>However, this was the second marriage for both of them. Jessica’s ex-husband was William Kress, a board of directors’ member of the Packer organization.</p><p>Talking about their kids, it is truly a mind-twister, so bear with us. Firstly, Mike and Jessica have two beautiful daughters: Gabrielle (2008) and Isabella (2011).</p><p>However, that’s not all because both have kids from their previous marriages.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Jessica-family.png><p>To illustrate, Jessica has two sons; George and Jack, while Mike has a daughter named Alex.</p><p>Moreover, Alex is the child of McCarthy and his high school sweetheart, Christine. The two married back in 1989 but got divorced in 1995.</p><p>However, that is in the past and should be left there. As of now, Jessica and her husband are in a joyous relationship with no signs of a breakup. The family of seven is living a happy life.</p><p>As a matter of fact, we believe that both of them have finally found their long-lost soulmates.</p><p><strong>You Can Also Read About <a href=# rel=noopener>the Wife Of The Magical Soccer Player Lionel Messi>></a></strong></p><h2>Jessica Kress | Social Media Presence</h2><p>As of now, Jessica does not have any social media profiles.
