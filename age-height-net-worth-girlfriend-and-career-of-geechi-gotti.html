Geechi gained fame as a battle rapper in the early 2010s after leaving a life of crime. He first played in the West Coast minor leagues. Geechi then started to battle King Of The Dot.</p><p>But Geechi made a name for himself in the Ultimate Rap League as a top battle rapper. He held his own when competing with people like Arsonal Da Rebel, Tsu Surf, Rum Nitty, K-Shine, T-Top, and Geechi.</p><p>In terms of statistics, Geechi watched 46 rap battles on YouTube (as of 2021). Verstracker.com estimates that each combat received an average of roughly 351,000 views.</p><p>Due to his outstanding 2018, Geechi received the title of “Champion of the Year.” The following year, he repeated the feat and solidified his legendary position. He rose to become the icon of combat rap and is one of the legends.</p><p>Online speculations claim that Geechi earned a cool $15,000 for each match.

Geechi was born in California, USA, on<strong> June 23, 1988.</strong> As a result, the well-liked battle rapper’s birthday fell on International Widows Day. Geechi also possessed the Sun Sign Cancer because she was June’s child.</p><p>Gotti was born in Compton, California, the same city that produced Dr. Dre, Kendrick Lamar, and Roddy Rich, three iconic hip-hop artists. Geechi claims to be a member of the same gang as the latter two.</p><p>He is a Crip, to be exact. In his rounds, Geechi freely brags about his prior gang involvement. Geechi was given a one-year jail sentence in January 2018. Of his two parents, Geechi respects his mother the most. He said the following in the Instagram post on Mother’s Day 2020:</p><p>kindly say ‘Happy Mother’s Day! I can’t even count on my hands how many times she came through for me when no one else would have this woman; she is the reason I am the man I am today.</p><p>Information about Geechi’s father and siblings was also kept from the public. He then used his actual name. But BayBay was Geechi’s nickname among his friends and family.</p><h2><span id=Is_Geechi_Gotti_Married_Wife>Is Geechi Gotti Married? Wife</span></h2><p>Geechi had not experienced the advantages of marriage as of 2021. He was aware of the type of fatherhood he felt, though. Geechi, a man who gave birth to two boys, kept his mother’s name a secret.</p><p>Geechi had a secret romance with an unidentified lady in 2020. The two’s affair gave rise to rumors that Pharma Funeral was living with Geechi’s Instagram account. Geechi eventually popped the big question to his sweetheart on Christmas Eve 2020.</p><p>He posted the information on Instagram. In his message, he gave his future bride compliments. Geechi further asserted that she was a reliable source of transportation for him.</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurement-_Height_and_Weight>Body Measurement- Height and Weight</span></h2><p>Geechi Gotti is a man who stands <strong>five feet eight inches</strong> tall and weighs about <strong>82 kilos.</strong> Speaking of distinguishing characteristics, Geechi weighs more than most.

Geechi, who is associated with Ruin Your Day/MAFIA Entertainment, released a surprise album in 2020 with the catchy title “Outta Nowhere.” In the past, he abandoned three “NoStudioN” initiatives.</p><p>Geechi uploaded a few songs to YouTube, but “My Condolences” caught the most attention. The song served as a memorial to the late hip-hop legends Nipsey Hussle and Crip.</p><h2><span id=Social_media>Social media</span></h2><p>Geechi Gotti had a sizable online following, similar to the majority of battle rappers.
