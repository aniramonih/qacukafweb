Gabriel exchanged his wedding vows with Swiss socialite Anouk Winzenried in July of 2021.</span></p><p><span>To know about his married life and parents' details, keep scrolling</span>.</p><h2><span><strong>Gabriel Jagger Married Life With His Wife</strong></span></h2><h3><strong><span>Gabriel Jagger Married Girlfriend Anouk Winzenried This July</span></strong></h3><p><span>Gabriel Jagger married Anouk Winzenried after multiple rescheduling wedding dates because of a pandemic. Finally, this July, the couple chose Gabriel’s stepfather Rupert Murdoch’s country home, Holmwood House in the Oxfordshire countryside, as their wedding venue. The ceremony was intimate and full of families and a handful of close friends and relatives.</span></p><p><span>Gabriel’s wife, Anouk, used to work as a therapist and life coach. According to LinkedIn, She got her degrees in Philosophy and Psychology from the University of Otago. Nothing much is known about her as she also keeps her profile low.</span></p><p><span>The groom wore dapper in a navy blue suit. Meanwhile, the bride looked gorgeous in an ivory slip dress with spaghetti straps and a deep V-neck cut. She had her hair in a half up half down with silver sea horse earrings that made her look simple and elegant.</span></p><h3><strong><span>Gabriel Jagger Was Engaged In January 2020</span></strong></h3><p><span><span>Gabriel Jagger and Anouk Winzenried's&nbsp;</span>engagement was announced via an official statement in January 2020. Still, their wedding plans were interrupted due to COVID-19 restrictions, and they had to postpone their wedding dates twice.</span></p><p><span>The couple first met on a private island, Mustique, which is situated in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. According to some reports, Gabriel’s groom was employed by the owner of Mustique Company on the island. Moreover, Mustique is recorded to be the favorite island of Mick Jagger for parties.</span></p><p><span>It was revealed that initially, Mustique was their fixed venue for the couple’s wedding. However, they got married in Gabriel’s stepfather’s mansion. Gabriel’s parents Jerry Hall and Mick Jagger were also present at their wedding. The couple likes to keep their relationship private but shares only one photo of their wedding holding hands.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Net Worth Of Gabriel Jagger And His Career Details</strong></span></h2><p><span>Being a part of the Jagger family, Gabriel Jagger has taken his shot in modeling, as suggested by his sister Jade. He appeared on the cover of Another Man magazine as convinced by Alister Mackie, Jade’s friend. At first, he was apprehensive about facing the camera, but nevertheless, he turned out to be an outstanding model by appearing in the 2016 autumn/winter collection by Another Man.</span></p><p><span>The collection had his father’s most cherished clothes along with some unseen ‘Rolling Stones’ memorabilia. He also has upcoming works with fragrances brands.</span></p><p><span>Gabriel was born dyslexic, making it hard for him to express and give his thoughts a good structure. Therefore he found his way through poetry and expressed his emotions well in poems. He can be considered a poet who walks on the runway and appears in fashion magazines.</span></p><p><span>Strangely enough, he has also written a poem for his girlfriend’s ex-boyfriend. Gabriel has talked about his favorite genre, Dark poetry, with W Magazine in an interview saying,<strong> “It’s just about feeling .It’s a really hard question because it’s not about nature. Some of them are.”</strong></span></p><p><span>Gabriel loves to exercise and chose planking as one of his favorite things. He’s also an entrepreneur founding an online news platform called Whynow, which is strictly focused on sharing positive news across various topics.</span></p><p><span>He expressed his dislike for texting with W Magazine. He shared that he sounds furious when he actually doesn’t like texting and sends short replies, and people get annoyed with that.</span></p><p><span>Gabriel has made a lot of fortunes through his modeling career but is very secretive about his personal affairs, leaving us no pieces of information of his net worth, salary, income, cars, and other things. However, his famous father, Mick Jagger, has an estimated net worth of $360 million.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Gabriel Jagger's Parents And Siblings Details</strong></span></h2><p><span>Gabriel Luke Beauregard Jagger is Gabriel’s real name, and both his parents are celebrities. His father, Mick Jagger, is a 70-year-old living legend of rock and roll and the lead vocalist of Rolling Stones. He is also a film producer, songwriter, and actor.</span></p><p><span><strong>EXPLORE:</strong></span></p><p><span><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>How Much Is The Net Worth Of Jerry Hall?
