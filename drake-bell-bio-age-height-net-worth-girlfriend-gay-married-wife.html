Drake Bell was a judge on the Miss Teen USA 2006.</span></p><p><span>After filing for bankruptcy a few years ago, Bell turned to his music in a bid to change his fortunes and rekindle his career.&nbsp;He’s been busy promoting himself on radio stations across the country, meeting&nbsp;</span><span>Drake and Josh</span><span>&nbsp;fans, and promoting the Drake Bell Entertainment YouTube channel.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Bio, Age</span></strong></h2><p><span>Born Jared Drake Bell on June 27, 1986 in SantaAna, California to Robin and Joe Bell, Drake is of English and Scandinavian descent.&nbsp;His mother, Robin Dodson, was a professional pool player.&nbsp;He has three older brothers, Joey, Rob and Travis and an older sister, Kellie.&nbsp;Her parents divorced and in 1995 her mother remarried her current husband Roy.&nbsp;This added a number of half-siblings on his mother’s and father’s side.&nbsp;He attended the prestigious Orange County High School of the Arts in Santa Ana.</span></p><p><span>Drake Bell made his first TV appearance in a small commercial for Whirlpool Appliances when he was just 5 years old.&nbsp;He has also done commercials for Pepperidge Farm Goldfish Crackers and Fruit Gushers.&nbsp;He debuted in a 1994 episode of Home Improvement.&nbsp;He has since proven himself in both arenas of comedy and pop recording.</span></p><p>Bell has his own Drake Bell group, originally called Drake 24/7.&nbsp;He also owns a record label, Backhouse Records, and is the face of The Thirst Project – a Los Angeles-based nonprofit that helps raise awareness and educate people about the clean water crisis.</p><p><span>Drake Bell’s career hasn’t been all rosy as he’s had his fair share of bad luck.&nbsp;In the waning times of 2005, the actor was involved in a car accident that left him with a broken jaw, fractured vertebrae, broken teeth and severe facial lacerations.&nbsp;Worse still, he lost his ability to play guitar due to an extreme wrist injury.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Drake Bell’s&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>Net Worth,&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>Height</span></strong></h2><p><span>Despite Bell’s career in television and film, plus three music albums, he filed for bankruptcy in 2014. He filed legal documents claiming a debt of nearly $600,000.&nbsp;His income couldn’t cover his expenses and his $1.5 million mortgage either.</span></p><p><span>His annual income had dropped from a whopping $408,000 in 2012 to a meager $14,000 in 2013!&nbsp;He also listed his monthly income at just $2,800, well below his monthly expenses at $18,771.&nbsp;He no longer lives at home because it was put up for sale by the bank.</span></p><p>Drake Bell is 5 feet 9 inches tall.&nbsp;His hair and eyes are dark brown in color.</p><h2><strong><span>Girlfriend</span></strong></h2><p><span>With a career in Hollywood that spans more than two decades, Drake Bell has certainly had his fair share of celebrity dealings.&nbsp;Her first relationship was with her&nbsp;</span><span>The Amanda Show</span><span>&nbsp;costar, Amanda Bynes.</span></p><p><span>He has also dated Canadian singer Fefe Dobson, American actress Quinn Paul, Torrey DeVitto and late YouTube sensation Stevie Ryan.&nbsp;Bell was devastated by the tragic death of his ex-girlfriend Stevie Ryan in 2017. According to the Los Angeles Coroner’s Office, Ryan, 33, committed suicide.&nbsp;Bell has also been in a relationship with model Melissa Lingafelt, socialite Isreali Hofit Golan, Tess Taylor and Paydin LoPachin.</span></p><p><span>Currently, Drake Bell is dating model and actress Janet Von.&nbsp;The two had met through a mutual friend and they ‘clicked’ instantly.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Is Drake gay?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Based on his past relationships, Drake Bell’s sexual orientation is straight.&nbsp;However, Bell came under fire after making a transphobic tweet in reaction to Caitlyn Jenner’s public debut in 2015. After the backlash, the former Nickelodeon star quickly deleted the tweet claiming it had been misinterpreted.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Married?&nbsp;–&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>woman</span></strong></h2><p><span>Currently, the “Drake and Josh” star is not married.&nbsp;Even though he’s had a long list of famous girlfriends, he has yet to tie the knot.&nbsp;He was the closest to marrying American actress Paydin Lopachin.&nbsp;Their relationship lasted 5 years and they got engaged.&nbsp;However, they never made it to the altar.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGicopa4pnnBnqOlZZKevG6txp5koZ2ZnLW1ec2eq2avn6fBqXnGoqmlnqKesq%2BwjKCYsmWdlr%2BztcSdZLChlpp8</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdrake-bell-bio-age-height-net-worth-girlfriend-gay-married-wife.html&text=Drake%20Bell%20%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Gay%2c%20Married%2c%20Wife&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdrake-bell-bio-age-height-net-worth-girlfriend-gay-married-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdrake-bell-bio-age-height-net-worth-girlfriend-gay-married-wife.html&title=Drake%20Bell%20%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Gay%2c%20Married%2c%20Wife" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdrake-bell-bio-age-height-net-worth-girlfriend-gay-married-wife.html&title=Drake%20Bell%20%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Gay%2c%20Married%2c%20Wife" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdrake-bell-bio-age-height-net-worth-girlfriend-gay-married-wife.html&title=Drake%20Bell%20%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Gay%2c%20Married%2c%20Wife" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdrake-bell-bio-age-height-net-worth-girlfriend-gay-married-wife.html&description=Drake%20Bell%20%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Gay%2c%20Married%2c%20Wife" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./emma-mctiernan-obituary-albany-new-york-emma-mctiernan-has-died.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Emma Mctiernan Obituary, Albany New York, Emma Mctiernan Has Died">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./doug-savant-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Doug Savant Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
