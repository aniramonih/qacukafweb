Due to his continued determination to be the best in his field to lead and serve and was awarded the opportunity to become Chief of Police of the Johnston Police department…where he led and served for far to short of a time…I know from talking to residents and a few officers he was extremely respected and welcomed into this position. Joe was a tremendous individual… calm…fair… determined… loyal… family first….goal oriented person….I was fortunate to meet him during the high school years and continued on into our professional careers….the amount of fun we had from working out..going to the north end…that pizza beer joint in the woods…fishing..renting boats..Corvettes and many other events we did together were magnanimous…..God bless you Joe<br>Joseph Razza rest in peace my friend….</p><p>As of now, the circumstances surrounding Chief Joseph Razza’s passing remain undisclosed, leaving the community in suspense.
