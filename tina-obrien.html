She is best known for her role as Sarah Platt on the soap opera, Coronation Street from 1999 to 2007. She is also known for her role as Bex Fisher on Waterloo Road and she competed on Strictly Come Dancing. Most recently, she has been doing guest appearances on a variety of television shows. Recently her upcoming wedding as well her her relationship with her ex-boyfriend have been in the news. There are several things that you may, or may not know, about Tina O’Brien.</p><h2>Early Life</h2><p>Tina O’Brien was born on August 7, 1983. She was born in Rusholme, Manchester, England and she attended Trinity C.E. High School. When she was 14 years old, she starred in the drama film, Children’s Ward. It is where she got her start.</p><h2>FHM Magazine</h2><p>In 2005 and in 2006, she was named one of FHM Magazine’s Top 100 Sexiest Women in the world.</p><h2>Children</h2><p>Tina O’Brien has a daughter named Scarlett Jacqueline Thomas who was born on October 26, 2008. Scarlett’s father is O’Brien’s ex-boyfriend and ex-costar, Ryan Thomas. On October 10, 2014, she gave birth to a son named Beau Lee Stephen. Beau’s father is her fiance, Adam Crofts. She is also the Godmother to Emily Walton. Emily played the original Bethany Platt, who was her onscreen daughter when she starred in Coronation Street.</p><h2>Her Fiance</h2><p>After Tina and Ryan split, she was devastated. She has stated that the breakup left her broken, and it took a great deal of support of her family and friends to start feeling like herself again. In 2011, she was sitting in a coffee shop. It was a year and a half after her breakup with Ryan, and she had no desire to date. When she saw Adam working on his computer, she was intrigued, and she went over and started talking to him. They exchanged numbers and a few weeks later, they had their first date. It took several months for Tina to be ready to introduce Scarlett to Adam.</p><h2>Family Dynamic</h2><p>Tina O’Brien is part of a happy, well-adjusted blended family, thanks in part to her fiance, Adam Crofts. He is a personal trainer and he formed a very close friendship with her ex, Ryan Thomas. It was Adam’s help that helped Ryan achieve the rock hard abs that he has today. It has taken several years, however, everyone involved has moved on to where they are all in a happy place. They even celebrated Christmas all together, as a family. This is not a common dynamic for most blended families, however, for them, it works great. Tina has stated on several occasions that she is thankful for the friendship that Ryan and Adam have. It makes it easier for the two families to spend a great deal of quality time together, which in the long run, is best for the children.</p><h2>Tina’s Engagement</h2><p>In May 2016, Tina announced her engagement to Adam Crofts after 5 years of dating. According to reports, they got engaged in a hotel room in Manchester hotel room. According to Tina, she was shocked when Adam got down on one knee at the Didsbury House boutique hotel and popped the question. He was dressed up in a nice button down shirt and there were candles and flowers all around the room. He also placed rose petals on the bed in the shape of a heart. Adam stated that he wasn’t sure that she would say yes but he was sure he wanted to marry her. He was ecstatic when she said yes. She showed off her gorgeous engagement ring in the June issue of OK! Magazine.</p><h2>Wedding Plans</h2><p>Even though they are engaged, Tina and her fiance, Adam Croft have not started planning their wedding. Because the two are so busy right now, they don’t have the time to plan the wedding of their dreams. She stated that they will start planning one day when things start to calm down in their lives. One detail that has already been ironed out is that Tina will be inviting her ex, Ryan Thomas to her wedding. She stated that it would be the right thing to do since he is the father of her child and he has developed such a close friendship to her fiance.</p><h2>Strictly Come Dancing</h2><p>In 2004, Tina was a contestant on the celebrity dance competition show, Strictly Come Dancing. It is similar to the Dancing With the Stars, which is a U.S. reality competition show. She was paired with Jared Murillo. She finished in 11th place out of 14 celebrities. She stated that even though she didn’t do well in the competition, it was still an amazing experience and she has no regrets about competing.</p><h2>Charity</h2><p>Tina is a celebrity patron and very active with the charity Animals in Distress Sanctuary. It is a non-profit, tax-deductible sanctuary for animals who have little or no hope. The program is designed to save the lives of these animals and prevent their suffering. Every animal that is admitted would receive care, and no animal is put down due to their age, injuries, or the fact that they are unwanted. She is one of the most famous people associated with this charity.</p><h2>Working Mother</h2><p>Tina has two children, and she is a working mother. In 2003, when she was 4 months pregnant with her daughter Scarlett, she filmed a guest appearance on Blue Murder. She returned to work just 13 months after giving birth to Scarlett and she began filming The Secret Diaries of Miss Abe Lister in 2010. She returned to work just four months after giving birth to her son in 2014 to begin filming Coronation Street. She stated that while working was important to her, being home with her children when they were young was more important. This is why she didn’t rush to get back to work after either of her children were born.</p><p>Not only is Tina a wonderful mother and a beautiful woman, she is also an amazing actress. She has a huge fan base and a promising acting career ahead of her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGiroqaRYryjvsiepWg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftina-obrien.html&text=10%20Things%20You%20Never%20Knew%20About%20Tina%20OBrien&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftina-obrien.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftina-obrien.html&title=10%20Things%20You%20Never%20Knew%20About%20Tina%20OBrien" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftina-obrien.html&title=10%20Things%20You%20Never%20Knew%20About%20Tina%20OBrien" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftina-obrien.html&title=10%20Things%20You%20Never%20Knew%20About%20Tina%20OBrien" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftina-obrien.html&description=10%20Things%20You%20Never%20Knew%20About%20Tina%20OBrien" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./adore-movie-ending-explained-plot-cast-where-to-watch-and-more.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Adore Movie Ending Explained, Plot, Cast, Where to Watch and More">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./151942-woman-loses-plane-bae-breaks-midflight-video-viral-i-honestly.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Woman Loses It on Plane After Bae Breaks Up With Her Midflight, Video Goes Viral: I Get Her, Hone">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
