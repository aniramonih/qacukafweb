She is also a proud member and supporter of the LGBTQIA+ community and has been open about her sexuality and relationship with her girlfriend, Aliona Baranova.</p><p>In this article, we will explore Jennifer’s journey of discovering and embracing her identity, her love story with Aliona, and her achievements and challenges as a queer woman in the entertainment industry.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jennifer_Englishs_Sexuality></span><strong>Jennifer English’s Sexuality</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jennifer has been open and proud about her sexuality and identifies as lesbian, queer, and gay. She has the LGBTQIA+ flag on her Instagram bio and often posts supportive messages for the community. She has also spoken candidly about her journey of self-discovery and acceptance and the challenges she faced growing up in a conservative environment.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Growing_up_queer_in_a_heteronormative_society></span><strong>Growing up queer in a heteronormative society</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jennifer English</a> was born on May 30, 1983, in Sleaford, Lincolnshire, England. She grew up in a rural area, where she did not have much exposure to queer culture or representation. She did not know what queer meant until she was about 11 or 12 years old, and even then, the only time she heard the word ‘gay’ was as an insult.&nbsp;She said in an interview with Gayming Magazine.</p><p>Jennifer English struggled with her sexuality for a long time, and tried to fit in with the expectations of society. She dated men, and even got engaged to one in 2021, but she called off the wedding and ended the relationship after realizing that she was not happy or fulfilled.&nbsp;She said in an Instagram post:</p><p>I was engaged to a man for 9 years. I was unhappy for 9 years. I was living a lie for 9 years. I was scared for 9 years. I was ashamed for 9 years. I was in denial for 9 years. I was miserable for 9 years. I was lonely for 9 years. I was lost for 9 years.</p><p><strong>See Also:- <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Who Is Emily Burge?

Aliona, who identifies as bisexual and queer, was the Mocap Performance Director for the game, and Jennifer was cast as the voice and motion capture actor for Shadowheart, one of the main characters. The two hit it off instantly, and developed a strong bond and chemistry.&nbsp;Jennifer said in an interview with Dan Allen Gaming Clips:</p><p>We met on the first day of rehearsals, and we just clicked. We had this connection that was undeniable. And we became really good friends, and then we became more than friends. And it was just the most natural thing in the world.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jennifer-English-with-her-girlfriend-.webp><p>Jennifer and Aliona have been dating since December 2021, and have been sharing their love and happiness with their fans and followers on social media.
