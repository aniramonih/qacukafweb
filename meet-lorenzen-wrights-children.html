At the time of his death in 2010 at the age of 34, he only had six kids, as one passed away in 2003.</strong></p><p>The former basketball player had his seven children with his wife, Sherra Wright Robinson. Sadly, their troubled marriage came to an end in 2010, shortly before the murder of Lorenzen, for which Sherra would later be arrested and convicted to spend 30 years behind bars, leaving their kids with neither a father nor mother at a very young age.</p><h2><strong>Meet All of Lorenzen Wright’s Children</strong></h2><p>As indicated, the former NBA star was a father of 7 children who were not fortunate to have him for a very long time. The kids have, however, grown and have done well for themselves.</p><h3><strong>Lorenzen Wright Jr.</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of birth</strong>:&nbsp;<span class="LrzXr kno-fv wHYlTd z8gr9e">11 April 1995</span></li><li><strong>Age:</strong>28 years old</li><li><strong>Mother:</strong> Sherra Wright Robinson</li><li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Basketball Coach and fitness expert</li></ul><p>Lorenzen Wright Jr. is the oldest of the children of the former NBA star. He was born on April 11, 1995, from his father’s marriage to Sherra Wright. His parents met when they were both high school students. At the time, his father was playing high school basketball while his mother was the daughter of Lorenzen’s basketball coach. His parents had him before they got married in 1998.</p><p>Lorenzen was drawn to basketball like his father. In fact, he started playing and had dreams of pursuing a career therein. He played collegiate basketball at Robert Morris University, where he studied Organizational Leadership. Everything changed after his education, as rather than continuing in the footsteps of his father, Wright Jr. chose to be a basketball coach just like his maternal grandfather.</p><p>After his graduation, Wright took a job with Teaming Solutions as a consultant, and then in 2020, he moved to LA Fitness, where he worked as a Personal Training Director. Next, he worked with Amazon as Area Manager. At the moment, he seems to be more interested in building his coaching career, although there is not much information provided about his career path.</p><p>With the absence of both his parents, Lorenzen has continued to play an important role in caring for his younger ones and ensuring that they remain closely knitted.</p><h3><strong>Loren Wright</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of birth</strong>: April 2, 1997</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 26 years old</li><li><strong>Mother:</strong> Sherra Wright Robinson</li><li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Nurse</li></ul><p>The second of Lorenzen Wright’s children, and his oldest daughter, is Loren Wright. She was born on April 2, 1997, which means that she was a young teenager of 13 when her father was murdered.</p><p>Her childhood has also been a private one, just like that of her older brother. However, she is now one of the most vocal members of the family as well as a protector of her incarcerated mother, and she has also been very protective of her siblings.</p><p>Lorenzen Wright’s eldest daughter currently lives in California. She did not follow the athletic paths of her father and brother, but instead, she decided to pursue a career as a nurse. She currently works with <span class="x193iq5w xeuugli x13faqbe x1vvkbs x1xmvt09 x6prxxf xvq8zen xo1l8bm xi81zsa"><span class=xt0psk2>California Highlands Addiction Treatment</span></span> (CHAT).</p><p>As regards her love life, Loren is now married to Joshua Phillips, who is also an athlete and a basketball player. It is because of this union that she has now changed her name to Loren Phillips.</p><h3><strong>Lamar Wright</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of birth</strong>: January 10, 2000</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 13 years old</li><li><strong>Mother:</strong> Sherra Wright Robinson</li><li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Athlete</li></ul><p>Lamar Wright is one of Lorenzen Wright’s children and has a twin brother named Shamar. Like all others, his father had him with Sherra Wright Robinson. The tall and talented lad was born on January 10, 2000, which means he is now 13 years old.</p><p>Now 6 feet and 7 inches tall, Lorenzen Wright’s third child plays college basketball for the Southern Illinois University Edwardsville Cougars. Before he came here, he attended Murrieta Mesa High School, where he also played high school basketball and holds the record for the highest point in a game, put at 38, before he graduated in 2018. A forward player, he will be eligible for the NBA draft in 2024. According to Lamar, one of the <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">reasons</a> he plays basketball and wants to go pro is because he saw the need to continue with the great legacy of his father.</p><p>The basketball player is a dedicated Christian. He doesn’t fail to always share bible verses on social media and also talks about his faith.</p><p>Looking at his personal life, the young Wright is now dating Masyn McWilliams. She is also a basketball player, and although how they met is not well known, the two are very much in love as they continue to share each other’s pictures on their social media handles.</p><h3><strong>Shamar Wright</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of birth</strong>: January 10, 2000</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 13 years old</li><li><strong>Mother:</strong> Sherra Wright Robinson</li><li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Athlete</li></ul><p>Shamar was also born on January 10, 2000, like his twin. He was born two years after his parents got married and was 10 years old at the time of his father’s death. Nonetheless, in the same manner as his twin, Lamar is now following in the footsteps of his father by playing basketball.</p><p>Shamar looks set like his brother to replicate the achievement of their father, who had a 13-year NBA career, as he will also be eligible for the NBA draft in 2024. Currently, he is a starter for the Southern Illinois University Edwardsville Cougars together with his brother. In February 2022, SIUE celebrated Shamar for reaching 1000 career points.</p><p>Only 10 years old when his father died, Shamar recalled the event of the day, remembering how his brother came and wrestled the remote control from him while he was watching SpongeBob&nbsp;and changed the channel. It was at that moment that he saw that his father’s body was found riddled with bullets. While he said he didn’t really process it, he broke down and cried.</p><p>In honor of their father, Shamar and his twin wear the jersey numbers of their father during his college days and his days in the NBA. Shamar wears No. 42, while his brother wears No. 55 for the Cougars.</p><h3><strong>Sierra Wright</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> March 14, 2002</li><li><strong>Mother:</strong> Sherra Wright Robinson</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 11 months (at death)</li><li><strong>Died:</strong> 1 March 2003</li></ul><p>Before the tragic passing of Lorenzen Wright in 2010, the family was hit in 2003 by the tragic loss of one of their members, Sierra Wright. She was born on March 14, 2002, and lived for the next 11 months before she passed away on the 1st of March 2003, a little before her first birthday.</p><p>The fifth of Lorenzen Wright’s children with Sherra when she was born, Sierra was said to have died on a Saturday morning at the family’s home in Memphis. According to <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">reports</a>, the child’s mother checked the baby’s crib at around 10:30 am that morning, only to be greeted with the sight of her baby who was not breathing. She rushed her to the hospital where the baby was pronounced dead.</p><p>Wright, who was away in Miami for a game flew back to be with his family after learning of the sad passing. His team, Memphis Grizzlies, wore armbands with his number 42 to show their support for his family.</p><h3><strong>Lawson Wright</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Mother:</strong> Sherra Wright Robinson</li><li><strong>Occupation</strong>: Student</li></ul><p>The least known member of the family is Lawson Wright. Details, including his date of birth as well as other personal information, are all hidden from the public domain. The only thing that is known is that he was born after his parents lost their earlier child, Sierra Wright, and he is the older brother to Sofia Wright.</p><p>A lover of music, Lawson is very close to his siblings. While he doesn’t share so much on social media, he makes it a duty to always celebrate his siblings.</p><h3><strong>Sofia Wright</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> 2007</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 16 years old</li><li><strong>Mother:</strong> Sherra Wright Robinson</li><li><strong>Occupation:</strong> High school student</li></ul><p>The youngest of Lorenzen Wright’s kids is Sofia Wright. She was born in 2007 and was only three when her father passed away. Because of that, she did not get to spend so much time with him.</p><p>Believed to be in high school, Sofia has been under the care of her older sister, Loren, since the demise of their father and the imprisonment of their mother. Sofia thanked her sister for always caring for her in an Instagram post.</p><h2><strong>Some Of Lorenzen Wright’s Kids Became Adults Without Their Mother</strong></h2><p>The death of the famous basketball star was not the last of the tragedies to befall the family, as nine years after the death of Lorenzen, his wife, Sherra Wright Robinson, was sentenced to 30 years behind bars for having a hand in his murder. This means that some of their kids were forced to continue growing up without both parents in their lives.</p><p>Sherra’s journey to conviction began with the death of her then-estranged husband on July 28, 2010, when he was found dead from gunshot wounds. Shortly before the sad incident, the Wrights were <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">divorced</a>, and Lorenzen had called his NBA career quits. Also, he moved to Atlanta, where he was living, but he came to Memphis to see his kids. A few days later, his mother reported that he could not be found or contacted. A search ensued, and his body was found.</p><p>Police swung into action to unravel the mystery behind the NBA star’s killing, but Sherra told them that her ex-husband was connected to drugs, and the last time she saw him, he was driving off with a man she had never met with a box of drugs. Police took a close look at all the information she gave, but with no lead, the case went cold.</p><p>The case remained unsolved until seven years later when a man named Jimmie Martin, Sherra’s cousin, started talking while he was held behind bars awaiting to be sentenced in a <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>murder case</a> of his girlfriend Martha Jean Bownes; a case that had nothing to do with Wright’s murder. According to Jimmie, he had colluded with Sherra and another individual whose name he gave as Billy Ray Turner in a failed attempt to have Wright killed.</p><p>Providing more <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">details</a>, Martin claimed that following the killing of Lorenzen Wright, Sherra and Billy met him, and the two confessed to having a hand in the murder, asking for his help. To give credence to his story, Martin led investigators to the lake where the murder weapon was hidden, some 45 minutes drive away from Wright’s home. To make matters worse for Sherra, investigators got incriminating conversations between her and Billy, and they were subsequently arrested.</p><p>Even before the confession of Martin and the interception of her conversations, Wright-Robinson had published a book in 2015, Mr. Tell Me Anything, in which she told a fictitious story of a woman who got married to an abusive and unfaithful basketball player. The book drew different reactions, with many insisting that if it was about Lorenzen, there was no truth to it. Others insisted that if it was based on her own story, then there was a motive for her to kill the basketball player.</p><p>Initially, she pleaded not guilty, but she later agreed to a plea deal that would see her spending less time than life imprisonment, which she would have gotten if she had been found guilty. She was sentenced for first-degree murder and was given 30 years behind bars, but could go out on parole by 2022 or 2027.</p><p>In 2019 when Sherra was sent to prison, Sofia Wright was only 12 years old, while her older brother, Lawson Wright still very young.</p><h2><strong>Wright’s Children Do Not Believe Their Mother Murdered Their Father</strong></h2><p>Even with strong evidence linking Sherra Wright to the death of the former basketball player, as well as her guilty plea, Lorenzen Wright’s adult children did not believe their mother had anything to do with the killing of their father.</p><p>The kids continue to stand behind her and support her because of what many <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">believed </a>to be their love for their mother and the difficulty in coming to terms with what she really did.</p><p>Her twin sons do not believe that their mother had a hand in the atrocity. Instead, they felt she accepted the plea deal because she saw the possibility of getting parole after a few years as against spending the rest of her life in prison if she was handed a guilty verdict.</p><h2><strong>Where Are Lorenzen Wright’s Children Now?</strong></h2><p>Lorenzen Wright’s oldest child, Lorenzen Wright Jr., is based in Los Angeles and is a fitness trainer and budding coach. His second child, Loren Wright, has also grown into an admirable woman who is very protective of her younger ones. As noted, she now works as a nurse and is already married.</p><p>Lorenzen Wright’s twin sons are in Illinois, where they play college basketball. They are the ones who have shown interest in taking after their father, as they currently play for Southern Illinois University Edwardsville with the hopes of joining the NBA soon. They have made it known that they want to continue with the legacy of their father, who died when they were only 10.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZLqmsdNmo6iqlaPHprqMsKmin5ipwG6vx6KjnaqVo3w%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmeet-lorenzen-wrights-children.html&text=Meet%20Lorenzen%20Wright%27s%207%20Children&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmeet-lorenzen-wrights-children.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmeet-lorenzen-wrights-children.html&title=Meet%20Lorenzen%20Wright%27s%207%20Children" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmeet-lorenzen-wrights-children.html&title=Meet%20Lorenzen%20Wright%27s%207%20Children" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmeet-lorenzen-wrights-children.html&title=Meet%20Lorenzen%20Wright%27s%207%20Children" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmeet-lorenzen-wrights-children.html&description=Meet%20Lorenzen%20Wright%27s%207%20Children" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./michael-thomas-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-120516-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Michael Thomas Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./179837-meet-cast-iconic-tv-show-life-goes-then-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meet Cast of Iconic TV Show 'Life Goes on' Then and Now">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
