Who is Ariel Pink dating?</p><h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p>Ariel Pink (real name: Ariel Marcus Rosenberg) is an American singer-songwriter and musician.</p><p>He is frequently referred to as the ‘godfather’ of chillwave and hypnagogic pop music, both of which draw heavily upon the 1960s-1980s nostalgia.</p><h2><strong>The Origin Story</strong></h2><p>Pink was born on June 24th, 1978 in Los Angeles, California.</p><p>His parents are Mario Rosenberg, a Harvard-educated gastroenterologist, and Linda Rosenberg-Kennett.</p><p>Mario and Linda divorced when Pink was only two years old.</p><p>Pink’s parents encouraged him to pursue his interests in painting and drawing rather than in music.</p><p>According to Pink, his parents believed that he was a talented painter, but had no musical aptitude.</p><p>Listening to his parents, Pink worked on his artistic skills to the detriment of his musical interests for a while.</p><p>Pink’s mother also encouraged him to take acting roles in plays.<img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Ariel-Pink-Net-Worth-Girlfriend.jpg.webp alt="Ariel Pink Net Worth Girlfriend" width=1200 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Ariel-Pink-Net-Worth-Girlfriend.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-1 data-svg=1 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Pink developed a love of retro music, and became an avid collector of old records.</p><p>His interests soon diversified into metal and death rock, and Pink has cited The Cure as his favorite music group of all time.</p><p>Pink was sent to Mexico City for a year by his parents, following a period of intense bullying at high school.</p><p>It was here that he discovered The Cure, a band that he said sounded “alive and dead at the same time.”</p><p>Upon returning to the US, where he lived with his father, Pink sold off his extensive collection of records, began identifying as a goth, and refused to listen to new music at all.</p><p>“Like many people, I got into music as a fan, as a listener and I didn’t have any natural abilities, or you know training or anything,” Ariel told <a href=# rel=noopener>Chuong Nguyen in an interview</a> in September 2022.</p><p>“But luckily I was into music that, you know, from a young age that sort of that was experimental in nature and was, you know, sounded like cacophony to most people. That gave me a little bit of a spring in my step.”</p><h2><strong>Early Career</strong></h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-66170 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ariel-pink-dropped.jpg.webp alt="ariel pink dropped" width=800 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ariel-pink-dropped.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-2 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-66170 class=wp-caption-text>@Getty</p><p>Pink began making music in the mid-90s, working in his father’s garage with makeshift instruments and a cassette recorder.</p><p>He kept the tapes of his performances, but did not release them (or intend to release them).</p><p>Pink’s first album was completed in 2000, while he was still studying at university.</p><p>He reportedly completed the album while binging on drugs, and rather than attending finals, he sold his album from a kiosk in order to protest the supposedly marketing-oriented courses the university offered.</p><p>Pink dropped out of university and went to live in a Hindu ashram in Crenshaw, Los Angeles.</p><p>He was extremely prolific over the next few years, Pink put out four albums and worked on portions of his fifth.</p><p>Unfortunately, his half-sister was severely injured in a car crash and suffered permanent brain damage and impaired motor function.</p><p>The incident affected Pink profoundly, and he stopped making music for several years.</p><h2><strong>Later Career</strong></h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-66171 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ariel-pink-label.jpg.webp alt="ariel pink label" width=1200 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ariel-pink-label.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-3 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-66171 class=wp-caption-text>@Getty</p><p>Pink gained in popularity a lot following his return to the music scene.</p><p>He released his first studio album, Before Today, in 2010; the album was critically acclaimed and established Pink as a lo-fi phenomenon.</p><p>Before Today was listed as album of the year by several music publications, and the single Round and Round was chosen by Pitchfork as its song of the year.</p><p>Pink vacillated between different approaches over the next ten years, often alienating both fans and collaborators as he changed his style and approach.</p><p>In 2021, Pink performed at a rally in support of Donald Trump, a move that alienated a lot of his previous collaborators and caused some to completely sever ties with him.</p><p>Though he continues to release material, he has failed to recapture the success he enjoyed with earlier projects.</p><h2>Wife / Girlfriend</h2><p>Pink was married in his early 20s, but their union was short-lived, and they divorced in 2004.</p><p>Ariel Pink also dated the musician Geneva Jacuzzi, a relationship that ended after two years.</p><p>In 2017, Pink was criticized by concert-goers when he physically restrained his bandmate and girlfriend (Charlotte Ercoli), at one point pinning her down and clambering on top of her.</p><p>Both parties claimed it was consensual, but Ercoli later claimed she had been pressured into downplaying the incident, and alleged physical and mental abuse on Pink’s part.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Where is Jelly Roll from</a>?</p><h2><strong>Ariel Pink – Net Worth</strong></h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-66172 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ariel-pink-father.jpg.webp alt="ariel pink father" width=1200 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ariel-pink-father.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-4 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-66172 class=wp-caption-text>@Getty</p><p>So, how much is Ariel Pink worth?</p><p>Pink earned most of his wealth from selling tickets to his concerts and selling copies of his EPs (Burned Out Love, Round and Round, Can’t Hear My Eyes, and more) and albums (Never Made A Demo, Ever, Dedicated to Bobby Jameson, Worn Copy, and more).</p><p>On Spotify, Aried has about 700k monthly listeners.</p><p>Therefore, Ariel Pink has an estimated net worth of $2 million.</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT:</strong> <a href=#>Who is DJ Quicksilva’s wife</a>?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaK8tr%2FPnqappJWpvKWt2GeaqKVflr%2Bqsctmp6Kmm2K7psCMsKarrJhk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fariel-pink-net-worth.html&text=Ariel%20Pink%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Girlfriend&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fariel-pink-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fariel-pink-net-worth.html&title=Ariel%20Pink%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Girlfriend" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fariel-pink-net-worth.html&title=Ariel%20Pink%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Girlfriend" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fariel-pink-net-worth.html&title=Ariel%20Pink%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Girlfriend" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fariel-pink-net-worth.html&description=Ariel%20Pink%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Girlfriend" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ashley-banjo-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ashley Banjo Net Worth, Spouse &amp;amp;
