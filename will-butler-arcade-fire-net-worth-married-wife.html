He has been married to Jenny Shore, and Will specializes in synthesizer, bass and guitar, and percussion.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><strong><span>Will Butler Left The Band 'Arcade Fire' After 18 Years</span></strong></h2><p><span>Will Butler has announced his departure from indie rock band Arcade Fire via Twitter on Saturday, March 20, 2022. Will Butler was an instrumentalist, longtime member, and brother to frontman Win Butler.</span>&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>I left at the end of last year, after the new record was complete. There was no acute reason beyond that I’ve changed—and the band has changed—over the last almost 20 years. Time for new things.</p>— Will Butler (@butlerwills) <a href=#>March 19, 2022</a><p><span>He tweeted, <strong>"Hi friends- I've left Arcade Fire,"</strong> and he posted a series of tweets where he explained that he left the band at the end of last year when the new record was completed. He added that he had changed and the band had changed over the last almost 20 years and how he had no acute reason for his departure. He wrote, <strong>"Time for new things."</strong></span></p><p><span>Will also mentioned that he was currently on a new record and had booked some shows this summer. He also said that he was working on music for a David Adjmi play and a few other projects. Will then wrote that he was at Paul Farmer's memorial service. He added that he would still be working with @plusforg and @pih and other activists and elected officials he had met.</span></p><p><span>He then thanked his fans and everyone who came out to their shows and loved their music and said that it was meant to be a part of their lives. He also expressed his gratefulness to the crew, staff, management, label people, bands, artists, and friends who helped bring his vision to life for so many years.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net Worth And Solo Career</span></strong></h2><p><span>Will Butler has a <a href=# rel=noopener>net worth</a> of $5 million.</span></p><p><span>Will Butler, the brother of Win Butler, was a member of the rock indie band Arcade Fire since 2001. The band released their debut studio album Funeral in 2004 and sold more than a half-million copies in the US. Their second album was also successful and reached #1 in Canada and Ireland and #2 in the United States and the UK. Eventually, their albums and singles were a major success and gained many recognitions from international audiences.</span></p><p><span>Arcade Fire's latest album was in 2013, and the album became a major hit in five countries. They even won the 2011 Grammy Award for Album of the Year. Will Butler was also nominated for an Academy Award as he did a perfect job for the original score of the movie Her in 2014. Will Butler also has his solo career apart from his time in the band. He shared that his solo had more slapstick comedy in his music and was lighter.</span></p><p><span>Some of his singles and EPs are Anna, City On A Hill, Bethlehem, Surrender, Hard Times, Close My Eyes, Christmas 2014, and more.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Is Will Butler Married? Who Is His Wife?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Will Butler has been married for almost 15 years now with his wife, Jenny Shore. They tied the knot in January 2008 and have a son named Alvin. His wife is a dancer, and he once cast his family into his solo single, Friday Night music video. Comedian-actress Jo Firestone directed the video.</span></p><p><span>Will Butler and his wife, Jenny Shore, uploaded a YouTube video on the Stealthisdance channel in 2009. The couple can be seen doing some incredible dancing hand movements.</span></p><p></p><p><span>As mentioned earlier, his wife is a dancer and choreographer, so the couple has some time for themselves to be learning new and unique dance steps.</span></p><p><span>Not much is known about his personal life as he is always focused on his work. Will bought a Brooklyn house in 2017 with his wife, and it cost them $7.4 million in Kensington, Brooklyn. Their house is a Victorian-style home located on East Fifth Street with five bedrooms and a two-car garage.</span></p><p><span>The couple also renovated but kept their original parquet floors, columns, and stained glass windows.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6CzZpOkunCvxKWcm6qZqbamv46woKWkXZfCtbjEq2SaqpOWsaZ5xaKpnmWemsFuw86rq6FlnZa%2Fs7XEnWSwoZaa</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwill-butler-arcade-fire-net-worth-married-wife.html&text=Will%20Butler%20Left%20The%20Band%20%27Arcade%20Fire%27%20After%2018%20Years&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwill-butler-arcade-fire-net-worth-married-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwill-butler-arcade-fire-net-worth-married-wife.html&title=Will%20Butler%20Left%20The%20Band%20%27Arcade%20Fire%27%20After%2018%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwill-butler-arcade-fire-net-worth-married-wife.html&title=Will%20Butler%20Left%20The%20Band%20%27Arcade%20Fire%27%20After%2018%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwill-butler-arcade-fire-net-worth-married-wife.html&title=Will%20Butler%20Left%20The%20Band%20%27Arcade%20Fire%27%20After%2018%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwill-butler-arcade-fire-net-worth-married-wife.html&description=Will%20Butler%20Left%20The%20Band%20%27Arcade%20Fire%27%20After%2018%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./yvette-prieto.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Yvette Prieto">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./mahsa-amini.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who was Mahsa Amini?
