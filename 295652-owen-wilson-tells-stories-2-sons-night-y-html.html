However, the actor has come under fire in recent years for neglecting his youngest child and only daughter, despite her mother's begging. Here are the details.</p><p class=dh>Since his career in show business began, American Actor Owen Wilson has proven to be a bundle of talent, continuously wowing fans with the perfect execution of his movie roles.</p><p class=dh>Away from the big screen, the Hollywood star's life is as worthy of attention as his thriving career. Over the years, Wilson has continuously given the tabloids and netizens what to talk about, especially due to his romantic escapades.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/c4ae0e604c623c718f18a6e45e289239.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Owen Wilson attends the Paramount+ 'Secret Headquarters' premiere at Signature Theater on August 08, 2022, in New York City. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>The actor has dated several women, famous and not, but has never said: "I do." But although Wilson has not tied the knot with any of his previous partners, the "Marry Me" star has fathered three kids with three of them.</p><p class=dh>In January 2011, the 53-year-old welcomed his first child and son, Robert, with his ex-girlfriend, Jade Buell. It was a huge milestone for Wilson, who later revealed that becoming a father was thrilling.</p><p class=dh>Before the arrival of his son, the Hollywood star was never interested in newborn babies, but the birth of Robert changed everything. It took the father of three one month to realize that he had formed a real connection with his son.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/c13f894b44c7a582cfe3b9f96efa2b7c.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Owen Wilson attends the 2022 French Open at Roland Garros on May 27, 2022, in Paris, France. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>During a chat shortly after Robert's arrival, Wilson <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/entertainment/news/a11188/owen-wilson-on-fatherhood-5/>noted</a> that he and his child were so bonded that the latter's cries were like beautiful music. Ultimately, Wilson cherished the moments he shared with Robert and could not have had it any other way.</p><p class=dh>A few years after the birth of his first child, fatherhood would get even better for Wilson. In late 2013, the actor confirmed he was expecting a second child with his one-time Personal Trainer, Caroline Lindqvist.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/f0a6e085db7494cba81717f594d853e1.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Owen Wilson attends the "The French Dispatch" screening during the 74th annual Cannes Film Festival on July 12, 2021, in Cannes, France. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>At the time, Wilson and his baby mama were reportedly not a couple or living together, but the actor was actively <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/owen-wilson-welcomes-son-finn/>involved</a> in Lindqvist's pregnancy.</p><p class=dh>According to a source, Wilson was always present during the doctor's appointments and ensured his baby mama was doing well and following the doctor's orders.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/71ae7132dc5953d208674fe10cbb16b6.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Owen Wilson attends Heidi Klum's 20th Annual Halloween Party at The Cathedral on October 31, 2019, in New York City. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>After months of active care from his former personal trainer, the duo finally welcomed their son, Finn, at 3 am on January 30, 2014.

However, the showbiz star occasionally shares his relationship with his boys. In August 2021, Wilson had an interview with Esquire, where he shared some highlights of his time with Robert and Finn.</p><p class=dh>According to the award-winning actor, one of the highlights was telling his sons stories at night in their pajamas, the same way his dad used to do with him and his brothers, Andrew and Luke. In Wilson's <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a37227718/owen-wilson-interview-2021/>words</a>:</p><p class=dh>"Sometimes telling the stories at night, you do take a little pride that these guys are into this story!
