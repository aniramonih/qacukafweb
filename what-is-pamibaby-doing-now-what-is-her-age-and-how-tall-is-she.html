She’s built quite a fanbase for herself on the internet, and is today <a rel=nofollow href=#>highly popular for</a> her YouTube channel ‘Pamibaby’, which she launched on 11 June 2016; it’s today subscribed to by nearly 200,000 people, and all of Pamibaby’s four videos combined have amassed over 4.1 million views; even though Pamibaby’s most recent video was posted over two years ago, she’s promised to her fans that she’d return to the video sharing service by the end of 2023, and start uploading new videos.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/affairpost.com///affairpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/wp9169662.webp><h2><span id=Education_and_early_life>Education and early life</span></h2><p>Pamibaby spent her childhood in Dubai, where she was raised by her businessman father and homemaker mother; she hasn’t revealed many details about her parents, including their names, because she respects their privacy. As Pamibaby’s yet to reveal whether or not she has siblings, most of her fans believe that she’s an only child.</p><p>She attended a local elementary school in Dubai, and was into a couple of activities during her time there, as she took dance and acting lessons, and enjoyed playing various sports with her peers. Pamibaby was 14 when she and her family moved to Houston, Texas USA, because of her father’s business endeavors; she thus studied at a local high school in Houston, and continued dancing and acting, appearing in a number of plays performed at the school.</p><p>Pamibaby <a rel=nofollow href=#>matriculated in 2018</a> ,and because she had already built quite a following for herself on the internet, she chose not to enroll at college.</p><h2><span id=Most_viewed_YouTube_videos>Most viewed YouTube videos</span></h2><p>Even though Pamibaby’s uploaded only four videos onto her YouTube channel, numerous people are still subscribed to it as they’re awaiting the upload of her new content; she’s mostly into speaking about her everyday life in her videos and we’re going to cover the four videos which she’s so far created, as these have contributed to her overall popularity.</p><p>Pamibaby’s most popular video “eye-lifting eyeshadow look (snatched) ^.^” has been watched over 1.9 million times since 2 June 2020 and features her talking about proper ways to use make-up, especially about how to achieve that ‘eye-lifting eyeshadow look’.</p><p>Her #2 video “my everyday makeup (GLASS SKIN)” has been viewed more than 1.2 million times since 16 June 2020, and also features her showing her fans how to do make-up, the same that she puts on every day.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p>Pamibaby’s third most viewed video “GRWM – WHO IS PAMIBABY???” has been watched nearly 600,000 times since 29 July 2021 and features her speaking about her everyday life while simultaneously putting on make-up.</p><p>Her #4 video “brown smokey eye-shadow tutorial (:” has been viewed over 430,000 times since 15 September 2020, and once again features her teaching her fans to do their own make-up.</p><h2><span id=Presence_on_social_media_networks>Presence on social media networks</span></h2><p>Pamibaby’s active on various social media networks, and these are today her main source of income.</p><p>Over 1.4 million people are following her on Instagram today, although she’s posted only 43 pictures and videos onto the network; most feature her spending time with her best friends, attending parties at nightclubs and showing off her large breasts.</p><p>Pamibaby created her Twitter account in June 2021, and there are today over 3,300 people following it, while she’s tweeted 100 times, most of which serve to promote her Instagram account and YouTube channel, although she also occasionally writes about her everyday life.</p><p>Pamibaby’s a TikTok star, as close to nine million people are following her today on the network, while she’s following back only nine accounts; most of her videos feature her showing off her large breasts, attending parties and putting on make-up, and all of these combined have amassed nearly 190 million likes.</p><p>Pamibaby doesn’t seem to allow her fans to interact with her on Facebook, as she prefers to use her account on this social media network only to stay in touch with her family and friends; she also uploads unique content onto Facebook, as her pictures don’t feature her shoving off her curves.</p><h2><span id=Love_life_and_relationships>Love life and relationships</span></h2><p>Pamibaby doesn’t shy away from speaking about her love life in public and it’s widely known that she’s today <a rel=nofollow href=#>in a relationship with</a> American Twitch star and social media personality Adin Ross.</p><p>The two have been together since April 2021, but neither has spoken about how they met; it’s believed that Pamibaby and Adin began chatting on the internet in February 2021, and then went out on a date two months later, but this remains unconfirmed. They’ve been seen spending time together by their fans on multiple occasions, and they also sometimes feature each other in their internet content.</p><p>There are no other boys whom Pamibaby’s perhaps been with, that we know about; she’s in a relationship with Adin Ross as of October 2023, hasn’t married and doesn’t have children.</p><h2><span id=Interesting_facts_and_hobbies>Interesting facts and hobbies</span></h2><p>Some of Pamibaby’s fans believe that she’s recently enhanced her breasts, and several ‘before and after’ pictures have been posted by them on the internet, however, Pamibaby’s yet to address these rumors.</p><p>She’s a huge fan of fast cars and her favorite brand is Lamborghini which she owns, and has shown off the car in some of her Instagram pictures.</p><p>Her boyfriend Adin’s Twitch channel’s today followed by over 7.2 million people, making him the owner of one of the most popular channels.</p><p>Pamibaby loves to do cosplay, and often shows off her costumes in her Instagram pictures. She goes shopping for clothes nearly every day, while she mostly enjoys buying lingerie.</p><p>Pamibaby’s also active on OnlyFans; she’s posted 21 videos and 28 pictures onto the network, and all of these together have amassed nearly 20,000 likes.</p><p>Pamibaby’s favorite actress is Jenna Ortega, and her favorite series is “Wednesday”.</p><h2><span id=Height_age_and_net_worth>Height, age and net worth</span></h2><p>Pamibaby’s age is 23.
