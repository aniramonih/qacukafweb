col-md-offset-1"><article role=main class=blog-post><p><span>Ariel Camacho was a Mexican singer and songwriter.&nbsp;He was popular as the founder and vocalist/guitarist of the regional Mexican music band Ariel Camacho and Los Plebes del Rancho, now Ariel Camacho’s Los Plebes del Rancho.&nbsp;The band sang mostly original narcocorridos, songs about Mexican drug lords and cartels.&nbsp;Camacho was also known for his uniquely expressive style of playing requinto guitar.</span></p><p><span>Part of what contributed to Camacho’s fame was his good looks and appeal to the opposite sex.&nbsp;Unfortunately, the rising star was sidelined too early – at 22, Camacho didn’t even spend five years as a professional musician, but his legacy lives on.&nbsp;Let us know why he has become famous for so long in such a short period of time.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Ariel Camacho’s Biography</span></strong></h2><p><span>He was born José Ariel Camacho Barraza on July 8, 1992 in Guamuchil, Sinaloa, Mexico.&nbsp;However, he grew up in Angostura, Sinaloa, where he began singing at the age of twelve.&nbsp;Ariel started playing the guitar at a young age.&nbsp;After graduating from high school, he performed at various concerts in his hometown and the surrounding area.</span></p><p><span>In 2013, Camacho teamed up with his friends, César Iván Sánchez and Omar Burgos to form a musical band.&nbsp;The trio named their band “Ariel Camacho y Los Plebes del Rancho”, meaning “Ariel Camacho and the Boys from the Ranch”.&nbsp;Ariel had met Sanchez aka “El Tigre” back in middle school.&nbsp;While the latter played rhythm guitar and backing vocals, Burgos aka “El Cenizo” played tuba.&nbsp;Ariel himself was a singer and at the same time played the twelve-string guitar (requinto).&nbsp;The band’s unconventional combination of musical instruments (guitar, requinto and tuba) was a major contributor to their rapid popularity.&nbsp;Additionally, their upholding of the classical legacy of earlier musicians in their genre contributed to their fame.</span></p><p><span>The group signed to DEL Records and thereafter released several albums/songs including&nbsp;</span><span>El Karma</span><span>&nbsp;(2014), “Toro Encartado”, “Te Metiste”, “Rey de Corazones” and later&nbsp;</span><span>Hablemos</span><span>&nbsp;(2015).&nbsp;They also performed at various concerts and enjoyed great popularity both in their region and on social media.&nbsp;The group also collaborated with other established singers and musicians, including Marca Registrada, Regulo Caro and Grupo Fernandez.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Ariel Camacho’s&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>Sudden Death</span></strong></h2><p><span>Unfortunately, Camacho’s success was soon diminished, just as death swept him away in a horrific car accident.&nbsp;The bloody incident happened on February 25, 2015 on the Angostura-La Reforma highway near Sinaloa, while the Mexican singer was returning from the Carnaval de Mocorito music festival around 2 a.m.&nbsp;It happened that in 1994 Camacho collided with three other models of Honda Accord car when he lost control of the vehicle.&nbsp;He died on impact along with two others while the other person was injured.&nbsp;However, some other sources reported that two people survived the horrific accident instead of one.</span></p><p><span>Reports after the incident indicated Camacho was speeding before the car veered off the road and crashed into a canal.&nbsp;Unfortunately, the day before, Ariel Camacho had invited fans to his upcoming US concert, which is scheduled to take place in early March 2015.&nbsp;Frontman Ariel Camacho and Los Plebes del Rancho died at the age of 22.&nbsp;However, his death was not the death of his band as his bandmates didn’t let the candle out.&nbsp;They continued to produce songs and hold concerts, but only renamed the group “Los Plebes del Rancho de Ariel Camacho” in honor of their late leader.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Family Facts About the Mexican Singer-Songwriter</span></strong></h2><p><span>– Ariel Camacho was born to Benito Camacho Sanchez (father) and Reynalda Armida Barraza (mother).&nbsp;He also had a sister named Kenya Camacho.</span></p><p><span>– Ariel’s family is very supportive of his music career in life and in death.&nbsp;After his sudden and tragic death, his father Benito later joined his band to produce a song titled “Recuerden Mi Estilo” in 2016.</span></p><p><span>– Late Camacho family members also join LosPlebes del Rancho de Ariel Camacho to commemorate him and his accomplishments since his death.&nbsp;Together with his band, fans, friends and well-wishers, the Camachos hold a solemn memorial service at the grave of the deceased singer every year on February 25th.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid
