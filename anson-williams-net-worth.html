Anson Williams is best known for his role as Warren "Potsie" Weber on the ABC television sitcom "Happy Days." Since then, he has appeared in episodes of such series as "Fantasy Island," "Fudge," "Baywatch," and "Sabrina the Teenage Witch." Williams has also directed episodes of numerous shows, including "Diagnosis: Murder," "Melrose Place," "Beverly Hills, 90210," and "The Secret Life of the American Teenager."</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Anson Williams was born as Anson William Heimlich on September 25, 1949 in Los Angeles, California to a Jewish family. His uncle, Dr. Henry Heimlich, is the namesake of the eponymous first aid maneuver for people who are choking. As a teenager, Williams went to Burbank High School, where he captained the track team and performed in a number of school productions.</p><h2 id=television-acting><strong>Television Acting</strong></h2><p>Williams made his television acting debut in 1971 in an episode of the legal drama series "Owen Marshall, Counselor at Law." The following year, he made his first appearance as the dimwitted and gullible Potsie Weber on the ABC anthology comedy series "Love, American Style." Williams appeared alongside <a href=#>Ron Howard</a>, <a href=#>Marion Ross</a>, and other characters who were eventually spun off into the sitcom "Happy Days." Debuting in 1974, "Happy Days" focused mainly on Williams' character Potsie and Howard's character Richie during its first season. Soon, <a href=#>Henry Winkler's</a> character Arthur "Fonzie" Fonzarelli became the show's breakout star. A hugely popular series, "Happy Days" ran for 11 seasons through 1984. Notably, Williams was one of the few actors from the cast to remain on the show throughout its entire run.</p><p>While he was still on "Happy Days," Williams appeared as his character Potsie Weber in an episode of the spinoff series "Laverne & Shirley." He also appeared in episodes of such shows as "The Love Boat" and "Fantasy Island." In 1984, Williams appeared in the television film "I Married a Centerfold." Later, in 1992, he reunited with his former cast mates for "The Happy Days Reunion Special." Williams has since made guest appearances on shows including "Fudge," "Boy Meets World," "Baywatch," "Son of the Beach," "Sabrina the Teenage Witch," and the 2005 special "Happy Days: 30th Anniversary Reunion." In 2016, he appeared in the reboot of the sitcom "The Odd Couple."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-169278 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Anson-Williams-e1590076607525.jpg alt="Anson Williams Net Worth" width=400 height=400 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-169278 class=wp-caption-text>Vince Bucci/Getty Images</p><h2 id=television-directing><strong>Television Directing</strong></h2><p>Following the end of "Happy Days," Williams began a prolific career directing television shows.

In the early-to-mid 90s, he directed episodes of the shows "Diagnosis: Murder," "Heaven Help Us," "Robin's Hoods," "Live Shot," "Fudge," and "seaQuest 2032." Later in the decade, Williams directed nine episodes apiece of the primetime soap opera "Melrose Place" and the teen drama "Beverly Hills, 90210." He also directed episodes of "The Pretender," "Clueless," "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine," and "Star Trek: Voyager," among other shows.</p><p>Williams' other notable television directing credits have included "Sabrina the Teenage Witch," "Baywatch," "Charmed," and the Disney Channel series "Lizzie McGuire."
