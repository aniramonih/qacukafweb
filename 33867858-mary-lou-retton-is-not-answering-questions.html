They were preparing for a "girls' trip" and were set to go to Dallas...During the manicure, Schrepfer recalls her mom saying, "I just can't keep my eyes open. I am so tired." Later that evening, another one of Retton's daughters thought something was off when she started "to say things that don't make a whole lot of sense...But Schrepfer didn't think anything of it, and they shrugged it off as dehydration.</p><p>[quote]The former Olympic gymnast was found by a neighbor lying on her bedroom floor the day after the manicure, struggling to breathe. "I didn’t know what was wrong with me," Retton said, adding that she was trying to take in a "big, deep breath," but couldn't — something she said she still can't do as she remains on an oxygen apparatus in recovery from her monthlong stay in the intensive care unit.</p><p>[quote]But before Retton was admitted to the ICU, she was hospitalized for a "couple of days" and then sent home. "I wasn't being treated. I kept saying, 'I can't breathe,'" Retton said. Her condition quickly deteriorated, and she was rushed to the hospital and admitted to the ICU.</p><p>[quote]Retton said doctors still don't know what caused the pneumonia. She said she tested negative for COVID-19, the flu and RSV. Doctors also determined it wasn't bacterial or fungal.</p><p>[quote]When she gets stronger, she said doctors want to do a biopsy on her lungs to try to figure out what happened. But because the cause of the illness is a mystery, the timeline on Retton's recovery is unclear, Schrepfer said. "You don’t get to see the light at the end of the tunnel," she said. "So it’s a day by day recovery period."</p><p>Seems the doctors ruled out viruses and bacterial infections. Sounds scary, and mysterious.
