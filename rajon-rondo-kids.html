To make ends meet, Amber worked at a tobacco company in Philip Morris, USA, while also raising her four children.</p><p>Despite their financial struggles, the Rondo family remained resilient in the face of adversity, drawing strength from one another to overcome their hardships.</p><p>This determination and perseverance would ultimately shape Rajon’s character and drive him to succeed both on and off the basketball court.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Rajon-Rondo-For-Pelicans-634x1024.jpg><p>After completing his high school studies, Rajon Rondo enrolled at a Kentucky college in 2004, where he played basketball for the college team.</p><p>He was then selected by the Boston Celtics in the 2006 NBA draft, marking the start of his professional basketball career.</p><p>Over the course of his playing career, Rondo has achieved numerous accolades, including two NBA championships and four NBA All-Star selections.</p><p>He is widely regarded as one of the greatest point guards in NBA history, known for his exceptional ball-handling, court vision, and playmaking ability.</p><p>On January 3, 2022, Rondo was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers by the Los Angeles Lakers, continuing his professional basketball journey with yet another team.</p><p>Despite facing several challenges throughout his life and career, Rondo’s unwavering dedication to the sport and his remarkable talent has earned him a place among the basketball greats.</p><h3>Net Worth</h3><p>The estimated net worth of Rajon Rondo is <strong>$45 million </strong>as of November 2023.
