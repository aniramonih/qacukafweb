The 26-year-old rapper, whose real name is Daniel Hernandez, has been involved in numerous legal and personal issues, ranging from racketeering and firearms charges to domestic violence and child sexual abuse allegations. He has also been the target of death threats and violent attacks, both from his former gang associates and rival rappers.</p><p>In recent years, rumors of Tekashi69’s death have circulated online, fueled by his absence from social media, his erratic behavior, and his involvement in a federal trial as a cooperating witness. Some fans have wondered if he is still alive, while others have wished for his demise. In this article, we will examine the facts and the fiction behind Tekashi69’s death rumors, and reveal his current status and whereabouts.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tekashi69’s Near-Death Experiences</h2><p>Tekashi69 has had several close calls with death throughout his career, some of which were self-inflicted, and some of which were orchestrated by his enemies. Here are some of the most notable incidents that almost claimed his life:</p><ul><li>In July 2018, Tekashi69 was kidnapped, robbed, and pistol-whipped by three armed men, who allegedly belonged to his former gang, the Nine Trey Bloods. The men took him to his home, where they stole $750,000 worth of jewelry and $20,000 in cash. They then drove him around Brooklyn, threatening to kill him, until he managed to escape and seek help at a hospital.</li><li>In November 2018, Tekashi69 and his entourage were involved in a shooting outside a Manhattan restaurant, where they had a heated confrontation with a rival rap manager. The shooting occurred shortly after Tekashi69 had fired his entire team and announced his debut album, Dummy Boy. No one was injured in the incident, but Tekashi69 was arrested the next day on federal charges related to his gang activities.</li><li>In September 2019, Tekashi69 testified against his former gang members in a high-profile trial, in exchange for a reduced sentence and witness protection. His testimony exposed the inner workings and crimes of the Nine Trey Bloods, as well as implicated other celebrities, such as Cardi B and Jim Jones, as gang affiliates. His cooperation sparked outrage and backlash from the rap community, who labeled him a “snitch” and a “rat”. He also received numerous death threats from his former associates and their supporters, who vowed to seek revenge.</li><li>In October 2020, Tekashi69 was hospitalized after overdosing on diet pills and caffeine. He reportedly took two Hydroxycut pills, instead of the recommended one, and drank a McDonald’s coffee, which caused his heart rate to increase and his blood pressure to spike. He was released from the hospital after a few hours and recovered from the incident. He later claimed that he was trying to lose weight, as he had gained 70 pounds during his home confinement.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tekashi69’s Current Situation and Future Plans</h2><p>Despite the rumors of his death, Tekashi69 is alive and well, as of March 2024. He has been active on social media, posting pictures and videos of himself and his family, as well as promoting his music and merchandise. He has also been spotted in public, flaunting his signature rainbow-colored hair and tattoos, and surrounded by security guards.</p><p>Tekashi69 has expressed his desire to continue making music and entertaining his fans, despite the risks and challenges. He has also hinted at possible collaborations with other artists, such as Drake, Lil Wayne, and Nicki Minaj. He has also stated that he plans to tour internationally, once the pandemic is over.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Conclusion</h2><p>Tekashi69 is not dead, but he is living a dangerous and controversial life. He has survived many attempts on his life, but he has also made many enemies and lost many friends. He has achieved fame and fortune, but he has also faced legal and personal troubles. He has inspired and influenced many people, but he has also offended and alienated many others. He is a complex and contradictory figure, who is loved and hated by many. He is a living legend and a walking target. He is Tekashi69.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7JfqbKsrdKhoG9xXZmyosDHZqCsZaSdsm6vzqerq6emmr%2B0tcClZKuZoKWys3nRnpilpKlisaatw2amq2WRoba3sY4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftekashi69-death-is-the-controversial-rapper-really-dead-or-alive.html&text=Tekashi69%20Death%3a%20Is%20the%20Controversial%20Rapper%20Really%20Dead%20or%20Alive%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftekashi69-death-is-the-controversial-rapper-really-dead-or-alive.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftekashi69-death-is-the-controversial-rapper-really-dead-or-alive.html&title=Tekashi69%20Death%3a%20Is%20the%20Controversial%20Rapper%20Really%20Dead%20or%20Alive%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftekashi69-death-is-the-controversial-rapper-really-dead-or-alive.html&title=Tekashi69%20Death%3a%20Is%20the%20Controversial%20Rapper%20Really%20Dead%20or%20Alive%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftekashi69-death-is-the-controversial-rapper-really-dead-or-alive.html&title=Tekashi69%20Death%3a%20Is%20the%20Controversial%20Rapper%20Really%20Dead%20or%20Alive%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftekashi69-death-is-the-controversial-rapper-really-dead-or-alive.html&description=Tekashi69%20Death%3a%20Is%20the%20Controversial%20Rapper%20Really%20Dead%20or%20Alive%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./chris-rock.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Disney+ Star-Studded Mystery Thriller That Should Have Been A Blockbuster">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./suri-cruise.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Suri Cruise">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
