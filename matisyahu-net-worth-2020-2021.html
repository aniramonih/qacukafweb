If you do not know, We have prepared this article about details of Matisyahu’s short biography-wiki, career, professional life, personal life, today’s net worth, age, height, weight, and more facts. Well, if you’re ready, let’s start.</p><h2>Early Life</h2><p>Matisyahu was born on 30th June 1979 in Pennsylvania, United States, but he grew up in the White Plains city of New York, which is where his family settled eventually. He was raised in an Orthodox Judaism tradition and was sent to a Hebrew school for his early education. However, as he grew up, he became increasingly disillusioned with his faith and began to oppose the orthodox rules, which he was forced to follow.</p><p>For his higher education, he was sent to the White Plains Senior High School, but he soon got suspended for, allegedly, possessing drugs. In the pursuit of being a rock-star, he got addicted to drugs. However, after attending a few drug rehabilitation programs, he got rid of his addiction and started focusing on his career. Matisyahu, now a grown-up man, began to experience a renewed vigor towards his faith and began to attend Jewish spirituality classes.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>A film student at the New York University named Tahila once interviewed Matisyahu about a documentary exploring men-women relationships. Soon, the working association turned into a romantic one, and the couple got married in August 2004. Together, they were blessed to have three children named Shalom, Laivy, and Menachem Mendel. However, in 2012, the couple got divorced.</p><p>Matisyahu is also the father of a girl named Sasha Lillian from his former girlfriend, Toma Danley, whom he met in 1997 while attending a drugs and alcohol recovery program in the Bend city of Oregon, US. In May 2017, while he was on tour, he met an 18-year-old girl named Talia Dressler and fell in love with her. Matisyahu and Talia are currently in a live-in relationship and have not married yet.</p><h2>Age, Height, and Weight</h2><p>Being born on 30 June 1979, Matisyahu is 45 years old as of today’s date 20th July 2024. His height is 1.93 m tall, and his weight is 70 kg.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Matisyahu released his first album titled “Shake Off the Dust…Arise” in 2004, in collaboration with the JDub Records production. In the 2005 Bonnaroo Music Festival, Matisyahu was invited as a guest by the American singer and member of the “Phish” band, Trey Anastasio. In 2006, his second and third albums titled “Live at Stubb’s” and “Youth,” respectively, were released. He was again invited to the 2006 Bonnaroo Music Festival, but this time not as a guest rather as a solo set performer.</p><p>In 2007, he worked in a documentary film titled “Unsettled,” which was directed by Adam Hootnick. In 2008, he worked in another documentary titled “Call + Response.” On 25th August 2009, he released his next album titled “Light.” On 3rd November 2010, he recited poetry and performed his music at the University of Central Florida. On 1st February 2011, his next album titled “Live at Stubb’s, Vol. 2” was released.</p><p>On 8th May 2012, he aired the solo track of his previous song “Sunshine.” This song was included in his upcoming album titled “Spark Seeker,” which eventually got released on 17th July 2012. On 3rd June 2014, he aired a stripped-back soundtrack titled “Akede.”</p><p>On 17 August 2015, his live show performance at the “Rototom Sunsplash” reggae festival (Spain) was canceled due to his political inclination towards the Palestinian state. This led to huge outrage and criticism. Two days later, the act was condemned by the Spanish government, and so the organizers of the festival apologized to Matisyahu and reinvited him to perform on 19 August.</p><p>On 18 November 2016, Matisyahu aired a digital EP titled “Release the Bound,” which consisted of five brand new music songs. In May 2017, he aired his sixth album titled “Undercurrent.” In February 2018, his song, “One Day” was included in the film “Dream Big.”</p><h2>Awards and Achievements</h2><p>Since Matisyahu started his professional career, he has been appreciated for his rock and reggae music. In 2006, Billboard named him the “Top Reggae Artist” of the year. He was also made the spokesperson for an American fashion house called “Kenneth Cole.” In the 2006 “Esky” Music Awards, Matisyahu was awarded the “Most Lovable Oddball” award by Esquire magazine.</p><p>The Esquire magazine also awarded him the title of “the fascinating reggae artist in the world.” His album, “Youth,” was the best digital album of Billboard magazine. In the “Slamdance Film Festival” of 2007, he was awarded the “Grand Jury Prize” for his work in the documentary, “Unsettled.” His song, “One Day” was used as background music for the advertisement of NBC in the Olympic Games. His track, “Akeda,” was in the iTunes Top 10 list of the week.</p><h2>Net Worth & Salary of Matisyahu in 2024</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wealthypersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Matisyahu-Net-Worth.jpg><p>As of July 2024, The net worth of Matisyahu is $15 million. He has acquired this huge wealth from his various music albums and EPs released every year. He also earns lucrative amounts from his live shows. This grand wealth has given Matisyahu a very comfortable and luxurious life, which he enjoys.</p><p>Matisyahu is a person often known for his stiffness. When he came to know that the religious works which he was being forced to follow were nothing but mere orthodox beliefs, he opposed them despite severe criticism from his society. Again in 2015, his show in Spain got canceled because he believed in a particular political ideology and refused to promote others.</p><p>The show got canceled, and on the invitation, he had to face a few protests while performing, but he never limped and maintained a firm hold to his ideologies. Apart from a few controversies, his shows and albums have always been loved by the audience.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLHApauhsaCav7S7zaxlnKedZLqiwMissJqgpWK7psCMsKarrJhif3F%2Bj2ZpaWphZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmatisyahu-net-worth-2020-2021.html&text=Matisyahu%20Net%20Worth%202024%3a%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Dating%2c%20Bio-Wiki&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmatisyahu-net-worth-2020-2021.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmatisyahu-net-worth-2020-2021.html&title=Matisyahu%20Net%20Worth%202024%3a%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Dating%2c%20Bio-Wiki" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmatisyahu-net-worth-2020-2021.html&title=Matisyahu%20Net%20Worth%202024%3a%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Dating%2c%20Bio-Wiki" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmatisyahu-net-worth-2020-2021.html&title=Matisyahu%20Net%20Worth%202024%3a%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Dating%2c%20Bio-Wiki" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmatisyahu-net-worth-2020-2021.html&description=Matisyahu%20Net%20Worth%202024%3a%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Dating%2c%20Bio-Wiki" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./melissa-griffey-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Melissa Griffey  Bio (Wiki) ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./married-to-medicine-los-angeles-premiere-recap-5-03-20-season-2-episode-1.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Married to Medicine Los Angeles Premiere Recap 5/03/20: Season 2 Episode 1">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
