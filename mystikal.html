Mystikal raps about his ability to captivate the crowd, keeping them jumping from the minute he gets on stage. He boasts about his lyrical ability and his talent for putting together killer rhymes that make people feel the music. The chorus repeats the phrase "Been so long since he's been on" as a way to emphasize that Mystikal has been away from the music scene for a while and is ready to make a comeback.</p><br><p>Throughout the song, Mystikal uses vivid imagery and clever wordplay to paint a picture of his concert experience. He talks about the line around the corner, the packed club, and the adrenaline pumping backstage. He also encourages the audience to let loose and have fun, encouraging them to bounce their titties, shake their asses, and drop their pussies. The song ends with a warning to watch your back, reminding listeners that there's danger lurking everywhere.</p><br><p>Overall, "Danger" is a high-energy, party anthem that celebrates Mystikal's lyrical skills and ability to get the crowd jumping. It's a classic hip-hop song that remains popular to this day.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line
