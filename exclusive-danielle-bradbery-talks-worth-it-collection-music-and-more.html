If it’s inspiring others, count me in!!! I know we will all continue to put out inspiring messages for everyone to feel motivated and excited!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Your music is all about female empowerment, especially ‘Worth It’, what is your message to rising female artists?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Yes, if I can inspire others to feel powerful, then I will. My message to rising female artists is to be yourself and feel confident about it! As long as you’re true to yourself and you’re having fun, then it goes a long way!</p><p></p><p><strong>You released your sophomore album ‘<a href=#>I Don’t Believe We’ve Met</a>‘ last year, how do you feel your sound has evolved since your debut release?</strong></p><p>My sound has changed a lot. My first record came out right after I won The Voice and I wasn’t a songwriter yet. I took some time off after that experience to lay low and start songwriting. It’s a really therapeutic process. I found out a lot about myself, and I just was very honest in my stories on my second record.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You found fame on The Voice, do you think being a part of the show shaped the artist you are today?</strong></p><p>Yes!! I felt like The Voice was an industry boot camp. It gave you a little taste of lights, camera, action!! I know my confidence level went up throughout that show and I’m very thankful for that because I was a very shy girl. So, I thank The Voice for that almost every day haha!!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Along with making waves in the US, you’re also playing festivals over here in the UK this year how excited are you to be coming to Britain?</strong></p><p>I’m very very excited!!! I love adventures and seeing amazing places, especially being able to share my music with people over there. I’m very happy I’m coming to Britain!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Are there any UK country acts you’d like to work with?</strong></p><p>I think it’d be cool to do something that crosses over, out of genre. I would love to do something with Adele or Harry Styles. That would be so awesome.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What can your UK fans expect from your live shows?</strong></p><p>They can expect fun and honesty! I’ve been playing my new album and it has been so exciting to see the reaction. The first time I played in the UK, I was blown away from how amazing the fans were!! They were already singing every word. I’m pumped to be coming back!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Do you have any plans for a full UK tour soon?</strong></p><p>–It comes up in our meetings a lot. Right now I’m doing some festivals and opening for Thomas Rhett later this year. I’d love to do my own full tour one day!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Can we also expect new music from you soon?</strong></p><p>I’ve been focusing a lot of my time promoting “I Don’t Believe We’ve Met” but I have started writing again. Its such a fun process for me that I never really stop.</p><p><strong>Along with working on new music you have also recently released your debut accessories line, with ABLE how did that come about?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Yes!! ABLE is such an awesome company, and I’m so honoured&nbsp;to be partnering with them. All the women that make the jewellery&nbsp;are women who have overcome large obstacles in their lives. I felt like my song, “Worth It” was a really good reminder for them that they are worthy of everything they have and aspire for.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What’s the inspiration behind the collection?</strong></p><p>I wrote this song because I had a hard time standing up for myself. When I started playing the song in my shows, I realised&nbsp;that so many people could relate to it. So the collection is really a reminder to know your self worth, stand up for yourself, and be confident. The collection consists of a bracelet, necklace, ring, and leather wallet.&nbsp;</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I’ve partnered with <a href=#>@livefashionABLE</a> to create a <a href=#>#WorthIt</a> line available now! The spirit of the incredible females at ABLE inspired me immediately & seeing them wear the items with pride was a moment I’ll never forget. Can’t wait to see them on y’all too!! <a href=#>https://t.co/qjBA7cavlY</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/08V9nC4ZUP</a></p><p>— Danielle Bradbery (@DBradbery) <a href=#>April 25, 2018</a></p><p><strong>Were you involved in the whole designing process?</strong></p><p>I was. I wanted the line to be pieces I would actually wear. ABLE already had these rings, but they let me pick out which ones I like the best to put my message on. I usually prefer simplicity in the jewellery&nbsp;I wear, and these are very clean, dainty pieces.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What is your favourite piece from the collection?</strong></p><p>I personally love the “Worth It” rings!! I love rings in general and the fact that this has a message that I need to be reminded of is even better.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What message do you hope to project via the line?</strong></p><p>I hope it makes others feel confident and reminds them that they’re not alone when they don’t feel 100%. We all have bumps in the road that we are all dealing with, so why not overcome them together!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Was the message and work of ABLE important to your choice of teaming up with them?</strong></p><p>Absolutely. It’s how I knew about them to begin with. I wanted to be part of sharing what they were doing.</p><p><strong>Along with your accessories collection, and festival slots what else can fans expect from you this year?</strong></p><p>More shows, more videos, more fun collaborations. I’ve got a lot cooking right now and I’m so excited to share it with my fans!&nbsp;</p><p>Make sure you follow Danielle Bradbery on Twitter <a href=#>@DBradbery</a> to keep up to date with all her latest music and tour news!</p><p><strong>Did you enjoy our exclusive interview with Danielle Bradbery?
