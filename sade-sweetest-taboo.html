The singer seemingly has reservations about their relationship and trusts their lover with the weight of how they feel. The first stanza inquires if the lover will continue to love the singer should they confess their emotions, while the second stanza hopes that their lover will continue to bring out the best in them should they reveal how they feel.</p><br><p>The chorus and the third stanza detail how the lover gives the singer "the sweetest taboo," something so good and yet so forbidden, making it all the more alluring. There's a certain magic, a "quiet storm," about the lover that the singer can't get enough of, but they also recognize that their lover may be "too good for" them. Regardless, the singer would do anything for the lover and hopes that they'll never let go of what they have.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line
