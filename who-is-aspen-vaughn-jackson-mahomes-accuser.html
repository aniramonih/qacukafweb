She is an American citizen born on 17th March 1983. She is presently 40 years old and her zodiac sign is Pisces. Aspens comes from a White ethnic background and practices the Christian religion.</p><p>She was born in Omaha, Nebraska, to her parents, Henry Vaughn and Sheryl Vaughn, who have been married since 1979. Her father worked as a regional sales manager at Valmont Industries in Omaha while her mother is a sportsperson; she worked as a tennis instructor at Happy Hollow and Skutt Catholic.</p><p>Aspens grew up alongside her three brothers named Kaleb, Taylor, and Chase. She received her high school education at Millard North High School in Omaha, Nebraska, and then enrolled at Bellevue University where she obtained her bachelor’s degree. She also went further to attend the Culinary Institute of America in New York.</p><h2><strong>Aspen Vaughn is a Restaurateur</strong></h2><p>Aspen Vaughn is an entrepreneur and successful businesswoman. She is widely recognized as the owner of Aspens Restaurant and Lounge which is located in south Overland Park, Johnson County in Kansas. For many years, she has run the restaurant which is known for its delicious cuisine, vibrant atmosphere, and top-notch service.</p><p>Meanwhile, before she launched the restaurant, Aspen Vaughn worked in a number of New York’s top restaurants such as Le Bernardin, Jean-Georges, and Gramercy Tavern, among others. She has also been a regular contributor to the Atlanta Food Bank and the Atlanta Women’s Foundation.</p><p>According to Aspen, she, alongside her team, has always been out and committed to providing a welcoming and safe environment for her customers and employees and this was why she she was deeply disturbed and shaken following the incident where Jackson Mahomes, Patrick Mahomes’s brother, allegedly assaulted one of her waiters and forcefully kissed her in February 2023, leaving a faint bruise on her neck</p><p>Aspen Vaughn is divorced. She was previously married to a man whose identity is not publicly known and together they had two children; a son Houston Robb and a daughter Anna Robb. She is currently said to be dating one Jordan Michael.</p><h2><strong>Did Aspen Vaughn and Jackson Mahomes Know Each Other Before the Assault Incident?</strong></h2><p>Several media outlets went buzzing in February 2023 with the news of Aspen accusing Jackson Mahomes of assault. Jackson Mahomes is best known for being the brother of Patrick Mahomes, an American famous football quarterback for the Kansas City Chiefs of the NFL. Born on 15th May 2000, Jackson in his own right is a social media star and internet celebrity popular on TikTok and Instagram.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Aspen-and-Jackson.jpg><p>Meanwhile, it is notable that Aspen Vaughn and Johnson Mahomes had known each other before the incident. According to records, the social media star has been a friend of Aspen Vaughn’s stepdaughter and they also had a close relationship. The restaurateur once posted on Facebook a photo of Jackson and her stepdaughter together and captioned it “good kid.” This occurrence has, however, apparently put a strain on their relationship.</p><h2><strong>What Exactly Happened Between Aspen Vaughn and Jackson Mahomes?</strong></h2><p>On the evening of 25th February 2023, Jackson Mahomes allegedly shoved a 19-year-old male waiter several times in Aspens restaurant in Kansas. Not only that, but he also forcibly held the owner, Aspen Vaughn’s neck and kissed her twice without her consent.</p><p>In Vaughn’s own words; “Jackson kissed me out of nowhere”, and even though she tried pushing him off, he ignored her and continued to do it even two more times. Aspen also claimed that Jackson was under the influence of alcohol and his actions were totally unacceptable and unexpected.</p><p>The incident happened less than two weeks following the Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl victory in Glendale, Arizona. Since then, Jackson Mahomes has been in the spotlight, facing loads of criticism, especially on social media.</p><p>Standing firm in her claims, Aspens presented a video as evidence of Jackson’s misconduct. The clip showed Jackson grabbing her hands and making forceful attempts to kiss her. Meanwhile, Aspen revealed that she tried speaking to Jackson privately about the incident but he portrayed a shockingly nonchalant attitude and response toward her before she brought it out to the public knowledge</p><p>This incident has further raised serious concerns about the security and safety of customers and employees at Aspens Restaurant and Lounge, highlighting the urgent need for stronger measures to prevent workplace assault and harassment.</p><h2><strong>Jackson Mahomes Charges</strong></h2><p>Investigations immediately started going on by the police department following Aspen Vaughn’s claims and the authorities reviewed the surveillance footage from that particular evening. A few days later, Overland police confirmed that Jackson Mahomes was under inquiry for the two alleged incidents of assault in Kansas City and was later arrested on suspicion of aggravated sexual battery.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Jackson-Mahomes.jpg><p>He was subsequently charged with one count of battery and three counts of aggravated sexual battery which he pleaded not guilty to. The court affidavit also implied that Mahomes had previously caused problems at the same restaurant and had to be kicked out. At first, Jackson’s attorney, Brandan Davies, outrightly denied the allegations and said “Jackson has done nothing wrong” and that there is substantial evidence to back his claims.</p><p>According to Davies, the evidence refuted Jackson’s accuser, including the statements of the witnesses. He further stated that they have reached out to law enforcement to make available the fruit of their investigation for them to have a complete picture of the matter. As of May 2023, Jackson Mahomes was booked into the Johnson County jail and was going to face trial soon enough.</p><p>He is also being held on a $100,000 bond and was granted permission to contact three witnesses. He last appeared in court on the 16th of May 2023 and his preliminary hearing is scheduled to be on the 31st of August 2023. However, there are rumors that the case may be settled out of the court via a potential plea deal or settlement before then.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571KxmsKCfYra0ecCsp56mXauutrPHp2SjmZOgwLC6jKaYoaedmsBurcKcrKydomQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-aspen-vaughn-jackson-mahomes-accuser.html&text=Who%20Is%20Aspen%20Vaughn%2c%20Jackson%20Mahomes%20Accuser%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-aspen-vaughn-jackson-mahomes-accuser.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-aspen-vaughn-jackson-mahomes-accuser.html&title=Who%20Is%20Aspen%20Vaughn%2c%20Jackson%20Mahomes%20Accuser%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-aspen-vaughn-jackson-mahomes-accuser.html&title=Who%20Is%20Aspen%20Vaughn%2c%20Jackson%20Mahomes%20Accuser%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-aspen-vaughn-jackson-mahomes-accuser.html&title=Who%20Is%20Aspen%20Vaughn%2c%20Jackson%20Mahomes%20Accuser%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-aspen-vaughn-jackson-mahomes-accuser.html&description=Who%20Is%20Aspen%20Vaughn%2c%20Jackson%20Mahomes%20Accuser%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./joey-gaydos-jr-facts.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Joey Gaydos Jr.?
