Her net worth is estimated at $3 million in 2022.</strong></p><p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Selling The OC</a></strong>&nbsp;on <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Netflix</a></strong> would be perfect for you if you’re interested in the purchase and sale of breathtaking real estate assets. The Oppenheim Group, as the series’ name implies, is the center of attention as they attempt to grow their company and become a premier real estate firm in Orange County, California.</p><p>The Selling Sunset spinoff also introduces a lot of <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>new characters</a></strong>&nbsp;thanks to its new environment. The Oppenheim Group’s second office in Newport Beach developed this original proposal, focusing on The Oppenheim Group’s second office following the success of Selling Sunset.</p><p>When it comes to realtor <strong>Brandi Marshall</strong>, Selling the OC&nbsp;on Netflix shows that she is not just feisty but also diligent, truthful, and completely devoted to her family. Now that you know more about her professional background, you may gain a deeper understanding of her experiences and other aspects of her personal life.</p><p data-changed=false data-paragraphid=10>Previously, we touched on&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Brett</a></strong>,&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Jason</a></strong>, <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Alexandra Rose</a></strong>, <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Alexandra Jarvis</a></strong>, <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Gio Helou</a></strong>, <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Lauren Brito</a></strong>, <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Kayla Cardona</a></strong>, <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Alex Hall</a></strong>, <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Austin Victoria</a></strong>, and <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Polly Brindle</strong></a>.</p><h2>Brandi Marshall From Selling the OC Is a Realtor Who Is an Outstanding Communicator and a Shrewd Negotiator to Ensure Her Clients Achieve Their Objectives!</h2><p><strong>Brandi Marshall</strong>, the cast <a href=# rel=noopener>member</a>&nbsp;of Netflix’s&nbsp;Selling the OC, is a realtor who has patience, is an excellent communicator, and is a sharp negotiator to make sure her clients reach their final goal. She has also worked as a publicist for notable companies, including AM PR Group.</p><p>Brandi Marshall was born on January 4, 1987, and is 35 years old as of 2022. Every year in January, the California-based real estate agent celebrates her birthday. After the premiere of the brand-new Netflix reality series Selling The OC, she gained huge notoriety.</p><p>Brandi Nicole Marshall, a native of Rialto, California, has always been highly ambitious due to the underlying principles instilled in her and the challenges she observed as a child. She decided to pursue a degree in mass communication at California State University-San Bernardino after graduating from Eisenhower High School since it was a subject that piqued her attention.</p><p>After starting her career in public relations, she worked her way up until Brandi Marshall was a successful executive in the entertainment sector in the culturally varied city of Los Angeles. Viewers got a glimpse into the drama-filled world of the realtors at the Oppenheim Group in Selling The OC.</p><p>After the premiere of this new series, Brandi gained a reputation as a smooth talker. Her integrity is exceptionally well-liked by the public. Before making the switch to real estate in 2017, Brandi worked as a publicist for notable companies, including AM PR Group and 20th Century Fox Studios, for more than 15 years.</p><p>Although it’s not quite clear when she got her license, she did quickly succeed in making a name for herself as a Realtor Associate and a Consultant within this specific field as well. It should therefore come as no surprise that she currently appears to be associated with Active Realty and IRBY Real Estate Group, in addition to The Oppenheim Group in Orange County.</p><p style=color:#252525>The Oppenheim Group’s website lists Brandi Marshall as having patience as well as being an excellent communicator and sharp negotiator to make sure her clients reach their final goals. On the other hand, she offers complete, discreet service to sellers, buyers, and investors of Southern California property, to assist them in easily finding their dream homes. The fact that she has effectively entered the high-end luxury market and that her current listings are virtually always in the top millions of dollars is the finest part for her.</p><p style=color:#252525>In the Netflix original, Brandi acknowledges her marriage to <strong>Sean Marshall </strong>(<a href=# rel=noopener>@seanmarshall007</a>). Her husband, Sean, played professional basketball for 13 years before calling it quits. Additionally, he founded Team Challenge ALS, which raises money to support the treatment of neurological diseases, and Pro’s Vision, which aids potential NBA players in honing their skills.</p><p style=color:#252525>Brandi and Sean Marshall, her life partner, got married on June 26, 2019.
