In real life, Ellen Pompeo’s husband is more romantic than Derek Shepherd of the show.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Latest Update</h2><p>During a post-Christmas walk, Ellen Pompeo and her husband were spotted dressed snugly in their winter clothes. Their afternoon stroll following the Christmas break, they were accompanied by their children Stella, 12, Sienna, 7, and Eli, 4.</p><p>However, all of them were fully covered, and Pompeo wore a black woolly hat on her head, and a black face shield over her mouth and nose to keep her warm.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Meredith Grey’s Real Chemistry</h2><p>Ellen Pompeo who played Meredith Grey in the show has her relationship history been tumultuous, dramatic excellence during the previous 17 years of Grey’s Anatomy, but her love life outside of the show has been quite solid with her husband, Chris Ivery.</p><p>Ellen Pompeo is one of the most well-known faces on television, and since 2007, she’s been married to a famous music producer, Chris Ivery.</p><p>Pompeo, who is 51 years old, seems to be the greatest story ever about the finest <a href=#>relationship</a>. Their love story unfolded in a lovely but unusual way.</p><p>Let’s find everything about Ellen Pompeo’s husband, Chris Ivery!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>One of the Highest-Paid Actresses, Ellen Pompeo</h2><p>Ellen is an <a href=#>American actress </a>and producer who was born on November 10, 1969. Since 2017, she’s been a regular on Forbes’ year-end rankings of the world’s highest-paid actors.&nbsp;</p><p>Pompeo has indeed been shortlisted for a Golden Globe and has received a Screen Actors Guild Award.</p><p>Pompeo was born in Everett, Massachusetts, and then moved to Miami and then New York City, in which a casting director discovered her and put her in a L’Oreal commercial.</p><p>Shonda Rhimes’ ABC medical television drama Grey’s Anatomy cast Pompeo in her first significant role in 2005.&nbsp;</p><p>Meredith Grey, the series’ heroine, and the main character has been a surgical intern at the fictitious Seattle Grace Hospital since the pilot episode.</p><p>Grey’s Anatomy was a smash hit in 2005 and earned positive reviews from reviewers.</p><p>Notwithstanding her reputation as one of Hollywood’s <a href=#>top celebrities</a>, she has remained relatively anonymous and uses almost no Facebook and Twitter.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ellen Pompeo’s Husband, Chris Ivery</h2><p>Chris Ivery is really no stranger to the<a href=#> world of entertainment</a>, though, unlike Pompeo, Ivery prefers music to film. He worked as a music producer for most of his career, according to Us Weekly, and his talent can be heard in Rihanna and Ciara’s music.</p><p>Not only he is good at producing music, with the relaunch of Sergio Tacchini’s athletic line in 2019, but Ivery also shifted his focus to <a href=#>fashion</a> designing.</p><p>Chris was born and reared in the state of Massachusetts in the United States. He is 53 years old, having been born on February 7, 1967. He earned his bachelor’s degree from Harvard University. In 2003, Chris Ivory first saw his future wife.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2022, he will be 55 years old. Chris’ mom is Jewish, and his whole family observes Jewish holidays such as Hanukkah and Passover despite the fact that he was not born in a religious home.</p><p>For over three decades, he worked as a music producer and songwriter, including co-writing accolades on “Cheers (Drink to That),” which is a song by Rihanna.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2019, she decided to make a career move and entered the fashion sector. Sergio Tacchini, one of his favorite labels, was hard to come by in the United States, so he went right to the source.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Eternal Love</h2><p>One day when she was at the grocery store she met her love of life, Chris Ivery in Los Angeles. It was two years prior to her breakout role on the blockbuster medical TV show, Grey’s Anatomy.</p><p>The coincidences when they met for the first time were magical and hard to believe. Throughout a 2003 initial chat, the two realized that they grew up about 10 miles apart in Boston, Massachusetts, and were taken aback by the coincidence.</p><p>At first, their relationship was a platonic one. “We were buddies for six months,” Ivery said in an interview. “Then one night she just looked different to me.”</p><p>Soon after they became good friends, they started dating for years and finally decided to tie a knot. In their love story, Chris Ivery was the first one to propose to her.&nbsp;</p><p>Chris proposed Pompeo in November 2006, 3 years after their chance encounter at a grocery store with a 3.5-carat diamond engagement ring. On November 9, 2007, he said his “I do” in New York City Hall.</p><p>Although a city hall wedding may appear low-key, Pompeo and Ivery’s event was performed by former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg. It was on another level and a beautiful night.</p><p>Pompeo gave birth to the couple’s first daughter, Stella Luna, on September 15, 2009, according to Us Weekly. Sienna May and Eli Christopher, the pair’s next two kids, were born in 2014 and 2016.</p><p>Sienna May, their second child, was delivered with the help of a surrogate in August 2014. Pompeo didn’t disclose Sienna’s birth for another 2 months after it occurred. In December 2016, Eli Christopher, the young son, joined the family.</p><p>Pompeo now occasionally posts photos and videos of her children on social media, including adorable shots with Stella, Eli’s Biz Markie covers, and Sienna’s quarantine advice.</p><p>Pompeo is candid on what it’s like to raise multiracial children and the importance of communicating about race with people.</p><p>“I’m not afraid to talk about race. A lot of people get very nervous when you bring it up, and I understand why they do, but I am not afraid,” she revealed it to Jada Pinkett Smith on Red Table Talk in 2018.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Chris Ivery Was Not a Fan of Pompeo’s Kissing Scenes</h2><p>During their days on Grey’s Anatomy, Ellen Pompeo’s spouse wasn’t really in a favor of her repeated intimating scenes with Patrick Dempsey.</p><p>The ABC medical drama is entering its 18th season, and Pompeo’s Meredith Grey has been at the core of the show since its inception.</p><p>Meredith’s romance with Dempsey’s Derek Shepherd ended in disaster in season 11 when he died too soon, but their romance remains a key part of her journey.</p><p>According to an interview with Instyle, Ellen Pompeo told:</p><p><br>“Poor guy had no idea what he was getting into. I remember in the beginning it was really hard for him. He was like ‘This is not what I signed up for. You go to work and make out with that. I like Patrick and everything, he’s a good dude, but like really?'”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Net Worth</h2><p>Having earnings of $14.9 million in 2016, Pompeo was rated fourth on Forbes’ list of highest-paid TV actresses, now she has an estimated net worth of $23.6 million in 2018. Whereas, Pompeo’s husband, Chris Ivery has an estimated net worth of $70 million.</p><p>With allegations of infidelity, Pompeo and Ivery’s relationship appears to be built to last. In 2018, the celebrity said, “Just don’t try to change people,” she continued. “They are who they are, and when you married them, they were fine, so don’t expect them to change.”</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCxy6Wcp2WgpLqxsc5mn66rkpa7pXnCoamiq12ew6a%2B2Gg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fellen-pompeo-husband-chris-ivery.html&text=Ellen%20Pompeo%20Husband%20Chris%20Ivery%20Is%20Truly%20One%20Of%20A%20Kind%20%26amp%3b%20Is%20Even%20More%20Romantic%20Than%20Derek%20Shepherd%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fellen-pompeo-husband-chris-ivery.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fellen-pompeo-husband-chris-ivery.html&title=Ellen%20Pompeo%20Husband%20Chris%20Ivery%20Is%20Truly%20One%20Of%20A%20Kind%20%26amp%3b%20Is%20Even%20More%20Romantic%20Than%20Derek%20Shepherd%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fellen-pompeo-husband-chris-ivery.html&title=Ellen%20Pompeo%20Husband%20Chris%20Ivery%20Is%20Truly%20One%20Of%20A%20Kind%20%26amp%3b%20Is%20Even%20More%20Romantic%20Than%20Derek%20Shepherd%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fellen-pompeo-husband-chris-ivery.html&title=Ellen%20Pompeo%20Husband%20Chris%20Ivery%20Is%20Truly%20One%20Of%20A%20Kind%20%26amp%3b%20Is%20Even%20More%20Romantic%20Than%20Derek%20Shepherd%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fellen-pompeo-husband-chris-ivery.html&description=Ellen%20Pompeo%20Husband%20Chris%20Ivery%20Is%20Truly%20One%20Of%20A%20Kind%20%26amp%3b%20Is%20Even%20More%20Romantic%20Than%20Derek%20Shepherd%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./gemma-atkinson-bronzed-goddess-sultry-sheer-top-holiday-spain-gorka.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gemma Atkinson is a bronzed goddess in sultry sheer top as she holidays with fianc Gorka">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./doja-cats-scarlet-tour.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Doja Cats Scarlet Tour  A Sizzling Spectacle, Snakes, and Social Media Shenanigans">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
