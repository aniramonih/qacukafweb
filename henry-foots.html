It can increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, diabetes, and other complications. Losing weight is not easy; it requires determination and hard work. However, it is possible to achieve remarkable results with the right guidance and support. One example of this is Henry Foots, who starred in the first season of the reality show “My 600-lb Life”. Henry weighed 715 pounds when he started his weight-loss journey with the help of <a href=#>Dr. Nowzaradan</a>, a renowned bariatric surgeon. He managed to lose over 400 pounds and regain his independence and happiness. Although Henry died at the age of 54 on May 16, 2013, due to an unrelated illness, he remains an inspiration to many people who want to transform their lives. In this article, we will explore the wiki-bio of this remarkable man and his amazing story.</p><h2>Who was Henry Foots?</h2><p>Henry Foots was a 47-year-old man who appeared on the first season of My 600-lb Life, a reality show that documents the weight loss journeys of people who suffer from morbid obesity. Henry weighed 715 pounds at the start of his journey, which he attributed to emotional eating since his high school years. With the help of Dr. Nowzaradan, a bariatric surgeon, Henry underwent a gastric bypass surgery and lost 440 pounds. He also faced some life-threatening complications, such as flatlining during surgery and being involved in a fatal bus accident. Henry died in May 2013, but his death was not related to his weight or the accident. He was the first person on the show to pass away, but his story inspired many viewers to pursue their own transformations.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Henry-Foots.jpg><h2>The Life Story of Henry James Foot: A Man Who Loved Food More Than His Health</h2><p>Henry James Foot, the son of Addie Virginia Foots, was born on July 17, 1958, in Harris County, Texas, where he lived his whole life. He had a passion for food since his childhood, and he often snuck food behind his parents’ backs. He ignored the warning signs of his obesity and did not care about his weight. His mother, Addie, revealed in an episode of My 600 lb Life that Henry would hide food in the bathroom. As he grew older, his weight problem worsened. His father was unhappy with his eating habits, but Henry was too stubborn to change. Addie felt guilty for not intervening earlier.</p><h2>My 600-lb Life Transformation</h2><p>Henry was one of the heaviest patients on the TLC series My 600-lb Life, weighing 715 pounds at the start of his journey. He faced many troubles due to his obesity, such as knee aches, back pain, and difficulty in movement. He decided to go through weight loss surgery with Dr. Nowzaradan and appeared in four episodes of the show in 2012. He also followed a strict diet and exercise regimen and managed to lose 340 lbs, bringing his weight down to 375 lbs. However, his struggle was not over. He had to maintain a healthy lifestyle for the next 7 years, which was not easy. He finally reached his smallest point of 275 lbs, losing a total of 440 lbs. Henry’s story was both inspiring and heartbreaking. He demonstrated courage and perseverance in his weight loss transformation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Robert-Buchel-1.jpg><h2>Cause of Death and Bus Accident:</h2><p>Henry Foots worked as a shuttle bus driver. On November 29, 2012, he suffered an unspecified “medical incident” that caused him to pass out while driving a shuttle bus.&nbsp; The consequences of the incident were not very pleasing. The accident caused the bus to hit an SUV and then ran into a woman standing in a corner. Hurriedly, an ambulance was called and she was taken to the hospital. However, she could not survive the injuries and passed away. Luckily, a total of 11 passengers on the bus escaped with minor injuries. On May 16, 2013, Henry Foots passed away at the age of 54. The cause of his death was not related to his weight or the shuttle bus accident. Henry’s death was the first among the show’s patients, and he was followed by other My 600 lb-life cast members such as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert Buchel</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lisa Fleming</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">James L.B Bonner</a>.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><h2>Was Henry Foots married? His wife and children?</h2><p>Henry Foots was married to his girlfriend Lycurgus “Kirk” Walker. They shared a relationship for a year before tying the knot on August 21, 2011. However, the two went through a breakup before giving a second shot at the relationship. Henry and Kirk lived together for 13 years during which she also take care of him due to his ballooning weight. As Kirk felt her situation in the relationship was more of a caretaker than a partner they ended up breaking. Despite the fact, the two were no longer together Henry did not lose all hope. Henry still loved her and was willing to get back. After a few years, the couple rekindled the relationship. Henry also encouraged Lycurgus to undergo weight loss surgery and the couple promised to marry each other afterward. The couple married in a small wedding surrounded by close friends and relatives.
