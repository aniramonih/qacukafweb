On Jan 13th, 2019, <a href=#>TMZ</a> reported the <a href=#>news</a>, much to everyone’s shock and surprise</p><p>However, Holm remained articulate when she shared her thoughts on the situation with Ariel Helwani in an interview shortly after.</p><p>She admitted to wanting their process to be private but acknowledged that things didn’t turn out as expected.</p><p>Holm further expressed her preference for honesty and openness and said that she wasn’t looking to present herself as someone who lives a life free of trouble or imperfection.&nbsp;</p><p>In spite of the difficult circumstances presented to her, Holm gracefully expressed her opinion about making this matter public for everyone to see.</p><p>Holly Holm is well-known for her impressive MMA fighting career, but her private life remains a mystery. She recently stated that she was going through a divorce and spoke candidly of our struggles, regardless of our public standing.</p><p>Having seen many fighters coming out with stories of their personal battles, such as losing a loved one to cancer or addiction, Holm’s commentary serves to normalize the struggles every person faces.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite her fame, fans can relate to Holm’s struggles in an intimate way because of how open and honest she has been about her own challenges.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Holm’s husband?</h2><p>Jeff Kirkpatrick hails from Albuquerque, New Mexico, just like Holly Holm.&nbsp;</p><p>His parents, Toni and Vicki, raised him along with his two siblings. An accountant and finance major at the University of New Mexico, Kirkpatrick is known as the ex-husband of former women’s bantamweight champion Holly Holm in popular culture.</p><p>After dating for years, the couple tied the knot in April 2012 in Cancun, Mexico. Shortly after that, Kirkpatrick was employed by ADESA as a fleet manager for a short period before returning to Albuquerque to manage the family <a href=#>business</a> – AAA Roofing Co.</p><p>Tom, the founder of AAA Roofing in 1991, established a legacy that has been carried on for decades by his devoted children.&nbsp;</p><p>Notably, his son Jeff made a name for himself as one of the company’s key members after working his way up through the ranks and currently serves as its Vice President of Operations.&nbsp;</p><p>Jeff and his sisters have devoted their time and effort to ensure that their father’s small business grew into what is now a successful enterprise that continues to pass along expertise from generation to generation.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Holy Holm’s career&nbsp;</h2><p>Holm will prove to be an exciting <a href=#>UFC</a> Fight Night as one of the best-known female combat sports athletes, Holly Holm, announces her return.&nbsp;</p><p>Second, in the bantamweight division, Holly is up against undefeated fifth-ranked Ketlen Vieira and will be giving it her all to gain another shot at the 135lbs title.</p><p>On top of that, Holm made her UFC debut back in 2015 and achieved legendary status with her famous head kick on Ronda Rousey at UFC 193. As she goes for gold this Saturday night, one thing’s certain: expect the unexpected.</p><p>After her win over Ronda Rousey in Melbourne, Australia, Holly Holm was well on her way to building her own empire within the MMA world.&nbsp;</p><p>However, three months later, at UFC 196, she lost the title to Meisha Tate and, since then, has had a record of 4-4 throughout her fights in the UFC.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite this string of losses, it is certainly not for lack of quality opponents as they have all been current or former UFC titleholders, such as Cris Cyborg and Amanda Nunes.&nbsp;</p><p>Although she has yet to successfully climb back up to championship contention again, it isn’t through a lack of will or determination from Holly; many anticipate that she is almost on the cusp of achieving another shot at gold.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunDBxZxkn6GXncGmvoyhpqWkqWK1sLjMZp%2Buq5KWu6V7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fufc-fighter-holly-holm-husband.html&text=Meet%20Ufc%20Fighter%20Holly%20Holm%20Husband%20%20Where%20Is%20He%20Now%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fufc-fighter-holly-holm-husband.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fufc-fighter-holly-holm-husband.html&title=Meet%20Ufc%20Fighter%20Holly%20Holm%20Husband%20%20Where%20Is%20He%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fufc-fighter-holly-holm-husband.html&title=Meet%20Ufc%20Fighter%20Holly%20Holm%20Husband%20%20Where%20Is%20He%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fufc-fighter-holly-holm-husband.html&title=Meet%20Ufc%20Fighter%20Holly%20Holm%20Husband%20%20Where%20Is%20He%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fufc-fighter-holly-holm-husband.html&description=Meet%20Ufc%20Fighter%20Holly%20Holm%20Husband%20%20Where%20Is%20He%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./michael-oher-siblings.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Michael Oher siblings and their inspiring story of resilience">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./matthew-kim.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Matthew Kim Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
