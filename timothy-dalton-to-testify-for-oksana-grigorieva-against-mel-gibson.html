Well, you should go f**k him now, you know, you fickle c**t, because I don’t care.”&nbsp; Oksana’s letter to Eric came a day after she informed him of her plan to walk away from a $15 million settlement and to see “where the chips might fall” in the court battle.<br>&nbsp;<br>Eighteen days earlier, Eric and his firm had negotiated the deal which was basically hush money in exchange for the destruction of the secretly recorded rants.</p><p><span>Oksana claims in the e-mails, texts and documents all of the following</span>:</p><ul readability=6.5><li readability=-1><p>A furious Gibson once flew from Costa Rica to “spy” on her;</p></li><li readability=-1><p>During a jealous rage he even accused some of his own friends of hitting on her;</p></li><li readability=2><p>She admitted to her dentist Dr. Ross Shelden, who treated her after the January 6 incident, that Gibson attacked her;</p></li><li readability=-1><p>She told two other doctors she was “hit by a man”;</p></li><li readability=-1><p>She emailed a lawyer the night Gibson allegedly attacked her;</p></li><li readability=1><p>She also telephoned three friends — “Jimmy” and “Alicia and Robert Seidler” — the same night, who advised her to call the police; and</p></li><li readability=-1><p>She told “Jimmy” that Mel was “threatening to come and kill me”.</p></li></ul><p>Oksana wrote an email to her lawyer, in June last year, detailing the beating Gibson inflicted on her almost immediately after it occurred.&nbsp; “He hit me in the face with a fist and broke two of my front teeth, as well as he was choking me with his elbow and squishing my face down with the palm of his hand.”&nbsp;&nbsp; That attorney was Jeff Jacobsen, who is no longer working on Oksana’s case againt Mel.<br>&nbsp;<br>In her memo to Eric, Oksana said the emails to Jacobsen “prove I was in danger and scared.”&nbsp; All the detailed emails of the incidents of violence, pictures and all the correspondence, starting the 6th of January is evidence against the violator,” she wrote.</p><p>By documenting events soon after they happened, Oksana created powerful evidence supporting her claims that make her a victim of domestic violence, one law enforcement source said.</p><p><span>The memo Oksana sent to Eirc is as follows</span>:</p><p>June 3, 2010, 8:54</p><p>Hi Eric, pls call me when u can.&nbsp;&nbsp; just need to write this before I forget.&nbsp; his is what I found out about the Californias family court.<br>1. In cases of domestic violence smtimes the court does reward the&nbsp; nights to the father, but only if it wasn’t physical violence. The<br>opposition knows that and they din’t want to go to court they were&nbsp; threattenning me.</p><p>2. The violence toward the mother is concidered as violence towards the children in her arms and in the room. That’s 3 of us. They knew it. The judge Black and the judge Romero said to me that was not the case. That’s not true.They weren’t telling me the truth. Why?</p><p>3. In our case the physical domestic violence will substantionally deminish the castody from what it is now with out changes for at least a few years.</p><p>4. The fact that the father is working and the mother is at home, as full time mo is rewarded with more castody for the mom.</p><p>5. The relaitionship has ended becouse of mel’s domestic violence, based on his paranoia gelousy and volotility. He flew from costa rica one time when I was suppose to have finner wth a old friend to spy on me! He was very ashamed. Yelled and aqused many of his friends of absurd gelousy suspition. Many facts.</p><p>6. Tim saw a buise on my left eye as well as Mady (the facialist, how asked me what it was and I told her). Both will testify. Facts and<br>witnesses.</p><p>7. Two doctors will testify, show pix of broken teeth and the documentation of concation. I told them both I was hit by a man. I<br>told the dentist dr. Shelden that it was Mel.</p><p>8. On the night of the recording Mel I called Jimmy around or later, I put Mel on the speajer so Jimmy could hear his madness. I told him I was terrifyed in danger and need the place to stay with the baby that mel is threatenning to come and kill me. He told me to come to his place.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I called Alecia and Robert Seidler telling them the same thing, they suggested to book me a hotel on their name so he can’t find me.&nbsp; They all told me to call the police! All of them will testify. It proves that I was in great danger and recorded mel for the evidence.&nbsp;</p><p>9. Everything that I’ve send to Jeff Jacobson immidiately on the same nights as the violence happened, prove I was in danger and scared. All the detailed emailes of the incidents of violence, pictures and all the correspondence, starting the 6 th of January is evidence against the violator. The night of the recording emails to Jeff were showing that I was scared and in fear and danger.&nbsp; All my correspondence with him is collection of the evidence. Pls call.</p><p>If convicted of a felony, the Mel could face up to four years in state prison; if convicted of a misdemeanor, he could face up to one year in county jail.&nbsp;&nbsp; Either way it is obvious that he is guilty of seriously assaulting Oksana.</p><p><span>Image credit to Craig Williams/ </span><a rel=nofollow href=#><span>WENN.com</span></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaGpnpJ66sMDHsmSdmZypvK9506hkrZ2jqbanxYyfpqtln6DAorrAZp6roZekv6qx1Zpkmp%2BRnru0wIymnKVll56vtLvNaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftimothy-dalton-to-testify-for-oksana-grigorieva-against-mel-gibson.html&text=Timothy%20Dalton%20To%20Testify%20For%20Oksana%20Grigorieva%20Against%20Mel%20Gibson&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftimothy-dalton-to-testify-for-oksana-grigorieva-against-mel-gibson.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftimothy-dalton-to-testify-for-oksana-grigorieva-against-mel-gibson.html&title=Timothy%20Dalton%20To%20Testify%20For%20Oksana%20Grigorieva%20Against%20Mel%20Gibson" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftimothy-dalton-to-testify-for-oksana-grigorieva-against-mel-gibson.html&title=Timothy%20Dalton%20To%20Testify%20For%20Oksana%20Grigorieva%20Against%20Mel%20Gibson" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftimothy-dalton-to-testify-for-oksana-grigorieva-against-mel-gibson.html&title=Timothy%20Dalton%20To%20Testify%20For%20Oksana%20Grigorieva%20Against%20Mel%20Gibson" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftimothy-dalton-to-testify-for-oksana-grigorieva-against-mel-gibson.html&description=Timothy%20Dalton%20To%20Testify%20For%20Oksana%20Grigorieva%20Against%20Mel%20Gibson" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./domain-6-believes-boria-majumdar-is-the-journalist-threatening-wriddhiman-saha.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Twitter Believes Boria Majumdar Is The Journalist Threatening Wriddhiman Saha The Talks Today">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-mtv-emas-photo-highlights.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The MTV EMAs Photo Highlights">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
