Farley was known for his loud, energetic comedic style, and was a member of Chicago’s Second City Theatre and later a cast member of the NBC sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live between 1990 and 1995.</strong></p><p><strong>He then went on to pursue a film career, starring in films such as Tommy Boy, Black Sheep, and Beverly Hills Ninja. Farley died of a drug overdose at the age of 33.</strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=chris-farley-age></span><span><strong>Chris Farley Age</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Chris was born in the year 1964 February 15th and later died at the age of 33 years 10 months old. He died in the year 1997 December 18th.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=chris-farley-family></span><span><strong>Chris Farley Family</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Farley was born in Madison, Wisconsin and grew up in Maple Bluff. His father, Thomas John Farley Sr. (1936–1999), owned an oil company, and his mother, Mary Anne (née Crosby), was a homemaker. He had four siblings: Tom Jr., Kevin, John, and Barbara. His cousin, Jim, is Executive Vice President and President, Global Markets at Ford Motor Company.</p><p>Farley’s family is Roman Catholic and of Irish and Scottish descent. Farley attended Catholic schools in his hometown, including Edgewood High School of the Sacred Heart. According to Joel Murray, a fellow Second City cast member, Farley would “always make it to Mass.”</p><p>Many of his summers were spent as a camper and counselor at Red Arrow Camp, near Minocqua, Wisconsin.</p><p>He graduated from Marquette University in 1986, with a concentration in communications and theatre. At Marquette, he played rugby and discovered a love of comedy.</p><p>After college, he worked with his father at the Scotch Oil Company in Madison. He first learned the art of improvisational comedy at the Ark Improv Theatre in Madison, under the tutelage of Dennis Kern</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=chris-farley-career></span><span><strong>Chris Farley Career</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Saturday Night Live</strong></p><p>Along with Chris Rock, Farley was one of the new Saturday Night Live cast members announced in the spring of 1990. On SNL, Farley frequently collaborated with fellow cast members Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, Tim Meadows, Rob Schneider, and David Spade, among others. This group came to be known as the “Bad Boys of SNL.”</p><p>Popular characters performed by Farley included Matt Foley, an over-the-top motivational speaker who constantly reminded other characters that he “lived in a van, down by the river.” The name of the character was drawn from an actual friend of Farley who, during a troubled period, lived in a van near a river. The real Matt Foley later became a Catholic priest and appeared in the 2015 documentary I am Chris Farley.</p><p>In late renditions of the character, Farley used other names, depending on whom he knew in the audience until the real-life Foley went to the show and had his name used, at which point Farley felt the name best suited the character and refused to change it. Some of the mannerisms of the character were a combination of the positions Farley noticed his rugby teammates took on the pitch coupled with the voice his father used when he was angry.</p><p>Off-screen, Farley was well known for his pranks in the offices of Saturday Night Live. Sandler and Farley would make late-night prank phone calls from the SNL offices in Rockefeller Center, with Sandler speaking in an old woman’s voice and Farley farting into the phone and mooning cars from a limousine, and even once defecating out a window.</p><p>He was also known to frequently get naked and do various stunts for laughs. Chris Rock once claimed that he probably saw Farley’s private parts more than Farley’s girlfriend did. Sandler told Conan O’Brien on The Tonight Show that NBC fired him and Farley from the show in 1995.</p><p><strong>Film career</strong></p><p>During his time on SNL, Farley appeared in the comedy films Wayne’s World, Coneheads, Airheads, and uncredited in Billy Madison. He also appeared in the Red Hot Chili Peppers music video for “Soul to Squeeze”, which was a song featured on the Coneheads soundtrack.</p><p>After Farley and most of his fellow cast members were released from their contracts at Saturday Night Live following the 1994–1995 season, Farley began focusing on his film career. His first two major films co-starred his fellow SNL colleague and close friend David Spade. Together, the duo made the films Tommy Boy and Black Sheep.</p><p>These were a success at the domestic box office, earning around $32 million each and gaining a large cult following on home video.</p><p>The two films established Farley as a relatively bankable star and he was given the title role of Beverly Hills Ninja, which finished in first place at the box office on its opening weekend. Drug and alcohol abuse-related problems interfered with Farley’s film work at this time.</p><p>Production of his final film, Almost Heroes, was held up several times so Farley could enter rehab. He was known among comedic contemporaries and friends to be sensitive about how his comedy was perceived and was particularly hurt by harsh critical reactions to Tommy Boy, a film he enjoyed making.</p><p>He was particularly dissatisfied with Black Sheep, an attempt by the studio to recapture the chemistry on Tommy Boy, and was only 60 pages into the script when the project was greenlit. As a result, he relapsed on the night of the premiere, which required further rehab before he could begin work on Beverly Hills Ninja. After his death on December 18, 1997, his final completed films, Almost Heroes and Dirty Work, were released in the summer of 1998.</p><p><strong>Unfinished projects</strong></p><p>Farley was originally cast as the voice of the title character in the movie Shrek, recording 85% (or 95%, according to some sources) of the character’s dialogue, but died just before recording was finished. The filmmakers felt continuing the film with Farley would be in bad taste, so Shrek’s dialogue was re-recorded by former SNL castmate Mike Myers.</p><p>A story reel featuring a sample of Farley as Shrek was released officially in 2015. The original version of Shrek was more like Farley himself, according to his brother.</p><p>Farley was slated for another voice role in Dinosaur as a young male brachiosaurus named Sorbus who, despite his gigantic stature, was frightened of heights. After his death, the character was rewritten as Baylene, an elderly female Brachiosaurus played by British actress Joan Plowright.</p><p>At the time of his death, Farley had been in talks to costar with Vince Vaughn in The Gelfin and to star in a biographical film about comedian Fatty Arbuckle. Jim Carrey’s role in the 1996 film The Cable Guy was originally intended for Farley, but scheduling conflicts forced him to decline.</p><p>Farley was slated to appear in a third Ghostbusters film, which was at the time intended to be about a new trio of Ghostbusters taking on overpopulation in Hell. Dav Pilkey, an author of the children’s book series Captain Underpants, had wanted Farley to play the title role in a potential television series based on the books but discarded the idea after Farley’s death.</p><p>Farley had been in talks for the lead in an adaptation of the novel A Confederacy of Dunces. Farley even expressed interest in portraying Atuk in an adaptation of the novel The Incomparable Atuk. Both of these shelved projects, along with the Arbuckle biopic, have been alleged to be cursed as Farley, John Belushi, and John Candy was each attached to all three roles.</p><p>All three died before any of the films entered production. Rumors are that originally, Adam Sandler had written Grown-Ups in the mid-1990s, with Farley in mind for the role of Kevin James’ character, Eric Lamonsoff. In fact, it is said that had Farley lived, he very likely would’ve done most of the roles which James received.</p><p>Farley and his good friend David Spade were in talks on making a film based on his Matt Foley character. These plans were put to a halt, due to Farley’s death on December 18, 1997.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=chris-farley-deathcause-of-death></span><span><strong>Chris Farley Death/Cause of Death</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>For much of his life, he struggled with alcohol and illicit drug abuse; such addictions caused him to be suspended repeatedly from the cast of Saturday Night Live.&nbsp; Bernie Brillstein, who personally managed John Belushi and whose firm, Brillstein-Grey Entertainment, managed Farley, repeatedly sent Farley to drug and alcohol rehabilitation.</p><p>Following his final guest appearance on SNL on October 25, 1997, there was a visible decline in Farley’s health. Farley’s hoarse voice and flushed skin were the subjects of public scrutiny. In the final years of his life, Farley had sought treatment for obesity and drug abuse on 17 occasions.</p><p>On December 18, 1997, Farley was found dead by his younger brother, John, in his apartment in the John Hancock Center in Chicago. He was 33 years old at the time of his death. An autopsy revealed that Farley had died of an overdose of cocaine and morphine, a combination called speedball.</p><p>Advanced atherosclerosis was cited as a “significant contributing factor.” Farley’s death has been compared to that of his SNL idol John Belushi, who died at the same age of a similar combination of drugs.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=chris-farley-funeral></span><span><strong>Chris Farley Funeral</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>A private funeral was held for Farley on December 23, 1997, at Our Lady Queen of Peace Catholic Church in his hometown of Madison, Wisconsin. Over 500 people attended this funeral, including many comedians who had worked with him on Saturday Night Live and on film, such as Dan Aykroyd, Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, Lorne Michaels, John Goodman, and Phil Hartman among many others.</p><p>Farley’s best friend David Spade, who chose not to attend the funeral, stating years later that he had found it emotionally hard to handle Farley’s sudden death. Farley’s remains were entombed at Resurrection Cemetery.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=chris-farley-moviestv-shows></span><span><strong>Chris Farley movies/TV Shows</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>1.
