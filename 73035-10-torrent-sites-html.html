Some of the sites contain malware, and if your devices are not well protected, they can access your private information. Therefore, it is recommended that you have antivirus software or a VPN with malware blockers or adblockers.</p><h2>Best torrent sites for South African movies</h2><p class=align-left>Listed below are the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">top torrents websites</a> you can find easily on the internet, some of which have stood the test of time.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Top 7 VPN South <a href=#>Africa</a> 2019</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION:</strong> Never miss breaking news – <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">join</a> Briefly News' Telegram channel!</p><h3>1.The Pirate Bay</h3><p class=align-left>The Pirate Bay was founded in 2003 and is among the most trusted websites found online. It is blocked in over 28 countries around the <a href=#>world</a>, so if you want to access it from a blocked country, it would be advisable for you to use a VPN. Pirate Bay is also among the best torrent sites for games since it has a simple interface and an easy filtering system which enables you to specify what you want; this will save you a lot of time. The website also shows if the files are from users that are trusted. It has verified uploaders who upload quality content without hidden files, which in other cases can be spam files.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/7a0061d5141272f8.jpg><h3>2. 1337x</h3><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">1337x</a> has been there since 2007, and it has a loyal group of daily uploaders.

The content downloads contain information, such as the number of seeders, downloads, leechers, and when the moderators last checked the files. However, some occasional bad files that have spyware or malware can slip through, so it is important to keep your data safe.</p><h3>3. YTS.mx</h3><p class=align-left>YTS was founded back in 2011, and it mainly caters for movies from all around the world. It is very popular because of its high definition movies that can be fast downloaded. The website has movies that are favourable for anyone who has limited bandwidth because they have small sizes that do not compromise on the quality. Another great feature about the website is that the files are vetted; therefore, you can trust that you will not download dangerous malware. Nonetheless, a good adblocker or VPN with malware blocker would not hurt because of the pop-ups and page redirects.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/5a1f0497989041f3.png><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> 12 Top 9anime alternatives to watch high-quality anime in 2020</p><h3>4.

RARBG</h3><p class=align-left>RARBG was founded in 2008, and it is especially known for its high-quality video releases. Unlike many of the sites listed here, RARBG does not allow the general public to upload; only its verified moderators can do so, which makes it to have a smaller collection of files in comparison to the rest.
